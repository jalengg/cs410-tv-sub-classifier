The pivot from that emotion to his sheer annoyance with Milchick after was telling too. Was he simply annoyed that he had to do work stuff after work or was it a deeper sign of general life frustrations? His innie, so far, has always been upbeat and seemingly in a good mood even if he\u2019s minorly annoyed at someone. We\u2019ve only seen his outtie briefly but he appeared to not be happy. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to see how knowing he has a kid affects his happiness in the coming episodes. I think it\u2019s going to consume him and that\u2019s all he\u2019s going to talk about.",

Finally answered what O&amp;D does with the machines (3D printers making random objects), finally found out who's severed and who's not (Thearapist is part time severed, O&amp;D appear to be severed and not in on whatevers going on), finally found out whether severance can be activated outside the facility (YES), and of course, we finally see who is on the other end of the phone. \n\nNext week's shaping up to be the best episode yet and I've thought that almost every episode of the season so far.",

Seeing that and realizing that the chips are not location based and can be turned off and on remotely points to use for soldiers. Plus there was this line from Petey \"What if you were killing people for eight hours a day and you didn't know it?\" I think this is why we're seeing politicians involved in the plot too. And wow I don't know how Dylan is going to handle knowing that he has a kid, and knowing he'll never see him again.\n\n2) Maintenance was moving the doorways to make it harder to map the floor. \n\n3) Why was O&amp;D handling hatchets? And then a watering can?\n\n4) Do you think the mom with baby \"bradley\" is the severed one, or the mom pregnant with baby \"william\"?",

Now Dylan knows he owns fancy clothes in a walk-in closet and has a son. I don't see how his innie will ever be content with his work life after experiencing a taste of the outside. Milchick must have been desperate to get that card back, even though we already know they can't smuggle anything out of Lumon. Nor does the info on the card make any sense.\n\nLots of goat talk this episode is encouraging that we might get answers about that eventually. And it was personally very satisfying for me to see Mark's innie rebelling against Harmony and leading everyone towards O&amp;D. Surely Cobel, Milchick and Graner can't stop all of them if they decide to revolt.\n\nI didn't really understand what was happening during the \"maintenance\" sequence. Why did they have to disassemble/reassemble the elevator? Are they somehow changing the layout of the map?",

Her outburst at Mark, singing the Lumon song, praying to the Lumon shrine in her house and then going to Devon's in that weird outfit.

It was, so I thought I'd watch it then go back to sleep after that. Despite being really tired, it completely held my interest and I didn't nod off once.

Her husband is a politician advocating for Severance.\n\nWe got a time reference from 2 years ago that matches up with Mark's wife death. The news article also referenced a start of something 2 years ago. I think this matches up with the severed floor \"experiment\". I think the reason Harmony is so involved with Mark is because she has something to do with Mark's wife death. She is monitoring Mark for his effects of dealing with death as an Outie and as an Innie; which is why she uses his wife's candle, is getting close to Mark's sister. \n\nMilchick kind of soft confirms that it is possible to smuggle out information from a severed floor. He was desperate enough to search Dylan's home and awaken him at home. Dylan also learned way to much about his Outie. Lumon is losing hold on the severance floor and I'm sure history is repeating with the infamous coup.",

The best guess I have is that memory wiping is theoretically possible but is dangerous.\n\nMy thought with the black goo hallucinations that Irv is experiencing is that they are either something that any long term severed employee would experience, a side effect of gen-1 severing, or a sign that he was mentally tampered with more than once. When you combine that with the suspicion that Helly is either an Eagan or a Lumon exec, they may be more hesitant to mess with her brain beyond the initial sever and that's why things are getting so out of control - if a regular employee was acting out like her they would have nipped it in the bud, but they can't with her out of fear of causing brain damage.",

Myrtle said she\u2019d be the first woman CEO. Next in line of siblings was likely Ambrose, 2nd verse of poem, rhymes it with \u201cban those.\u201d\n\n\u201cBan those\u201d descending of Kier through Imogen from running stuff/whatever weird shit the Eagans were doing.  Irving didn\u2019t seem to care of any prior Egan CEOs aside from Jane, current, and Kier.

Have to work out what got added this week, but I would not be remotely surprised if Cobel is leading a Imogen bloodline coup against the rest of the Lumon family, end game of taking over? Punishing the others? There\u2019s a clear line between early Kier and what gets thrown around how. She\u2019s the religious zealot coming to see her fathers vision though in its purest form. Hence Irving over the top reverence for Kier, and his relationship with Burt who brings up early Kier and marvels at the art and it\u2019s early meaning.\n\nPetey was someone important to Cobel. She integrated his chip, was tragic when he passed away.  That\u2019s why she needed his chip.

Steiner created a quasi-religion/philosophy and set up a weird pharma company, but what he's most famous for is Steiner/Montessori schools.\n\nEdit: seems more likely it was Corbel's mother than her daughter (depending on what year it is in the show).",

This would explain why there is so much secrecy if they are trying to take over the world or helping to wage wars.\n\nThere could also be some sort of combination of the two.

It shows how urgent and important it was for Milchick to find the missing card, but it still seems kind of reckless and counterproductive to what they are trying to do with severance.  \nSo, it occurred to me how they could 'erase' specific memories \\*within the limitations of what we already know about how severance works:\\*  they could re-sever Dylan a new tiny partition that only contains that one memory of his outie's closet and meeting the kid.  They can't do this too often, because you'd run out of brain (or maybe it's bad to sever a person into too many pieces, or something.) So they only save this for when there's a situation that really requires it.  Then, if they just never switch Dylan over to that partition, then the memory is effectively erased (or quarantined); that is, unless he gets re-integrated.",

Those homes on the map Petey made have to be Mark's neighborhood, and it seems like Optics and Design are creating objects for the Outie world (almost like a Truman Show type thing). Thus, severance is used as a way to experiment on the Outie society, rather than the Innies being the subjects. This also means the code has to do with something regarding either regulating Outies, and perhaps the emotional responses are due to the Innies coming into contact with their Outies or people or events they are familiar with in the Outie world. I wouldn't be surprised if, for example, Alexa works somewhere within Lumen, or if there is severance between the real world and the Outie world.\n\nI also think this is why the senator's wife is acting cold and distant to Devon, though I haven't quite connected those dots yet. Either Devon is also a part of the artificial society and the wife knows it and is instructed not to mingle with them, or they both are, or the wife is some sort of Stepford wife type deal that the senator has been 'rewarded' with for backing Lumen.\n\nI also think there are multiple layers here if this is true; as in, the purpose of the Outie society also being Lumen is a result of something else, such as some sort of dystopic event. Maybe we're even talking about some sort of Matrix situation here by the end.",

Could be kids birthdays, the date their spouse died, their own phone number, etc. The innie's clearly recognise these numbers and they have emotions attached to them - but they don't know why. They categorise the numbers by emotional response and Lumon uses that data to fine-tune the chip. If MDR ever reaches a point where none of the numbers have any emotional response at all, then they've succeeded in completely eliminating outside influences from the severed employee.\n\nFor O&amp;D, I suspect it's a similar arrangement, but instead of numbers, they're 3D printing items from their outtie lives. Everything from trivial household items they have sitting around at home, to objects that may be linked to a traumatic event. \n\nMark's Wellness session echoed this. Seeing him construct a tree would be a huge blow for Lumon, because it's clear that some level of his subconscious is still aware.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my theory is that the \"work\" each department conducts is not actually \"important\", it's entirely irrelevant. The work doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is how the employees respond to it.",

While I don't think she (or the rest of the upper management characters shown so far) are actually severed, they buy into that philosophy so much that they're willing to do horrible things to preserve it.  Cobel's own tragedy is that she is an orphan, who also seems to have suffered through some kind of other illness that required hospitalization or even committal.  I'm sure Milchick's story is very similar.\n\nI also think that Lumon \"technology\" is very real.  Even if you think that bracelet in the shrine is her \"baby bracelet\", that puts Cobel in her 70s.  I think it's from some later event, and she was an early teen when she got it - making her even older.  She looks pretty good for 70+, right?  I'm making an assumption that the outtie world is modern times because Mark's phone in the band scene looks like a modern Nokia (line of cameras on the back top middle), putting the year sometime after 2017.\n\nIt's pretty clear that even for the people who buy into the company philosophy, everyone has a favorite - either Kier or Eagan.  Is this what the uprising was about?  Has Lumon broken down into 2 militant camps?  Those cards Dylan found in O&amp;D look like melee attacks.  And hatchets?  It also seems like each philosophy has some major differences.  What if one side believes in severance and one doesn't, and that's driving a wedge between them?  If so, can we also assume because of the 2 alternate versions of the coup painting that there is a single person or group controlling it all?\n\nAlso, about the card Dylan stole.  It never left the severed floor.  I think Milchick was talking to Graner (who was controlling the switch).  Dylan told Milchick that the card was in the second stall - and home bathrooms don't have stalls.  I think he's referring to the bathroom in MDR.  I don't think the scanner in the elevator is fake - we've seen it work for both written words (the \"I QUIT\" post-it) and the map.  But maybe some kind of programming as a part of the severance process makes the severed **think** some of this Lumon magic is real.  \n\nAlso, we learn something interesting about Milchick.  He DEFINITELY knows Dylan as an outtie - maybe even as a family member, but at least as a close friend (in the same way Cobel knows Mark). \n\nFinally, in Cobel's shrine in the same shot as the ID bracelet and tube, is that a FINGER TRAP?  We've seen Cobel playing with one before.",

I doubt the type of birth you have impacts latching issues. \n\nShe also gave Devon the shea butter for her nipples. Nipple ointment is very much a thing but it is interesting that this is a topical salve. It also would help Devon's nipples, but it isn't going to actually help the baby latch on. But it will be applied to where the baby will feed, so is there something in it?\n\nThis is (again) out there, but now I am wondering if what they're refining are babies in the womb? Is the cave the womb? Do they expire when they're born?",

      "body": "I went back and watched all of the episodes yesterday, paying careful attention to details (something I didn't do the first time around). I had a couple of thoughts that I hadn't yet seen posted, although it's possible they were. I didn't have the patience to go back and read 2238 (current count) posts.\n\nFirst, the goat/jester characters appear several times throughout the series. The painting that Burt and Irving admire together in the waiting area for the sessions with Ms. Casey have both characters. So does Mrs. Selvidge's shrine. I believe they both might be in Devon's home, too, but I have to admit, that was one scene where I was distracted. Also, the bathroom that Petey wears at Mark's house (red and blue brightly striped that Mark thinks is ugly) is very reminiscent of the Jester's stripes on his headpiece.\n\nSecond, the Senator's wife reminds me of a Stepford Wife (if any of you remember the movie), particularly on the playground. She seems to be more engaging and more of a real person talking to Devon when they meet over coffee and labor. On the playground, she was either confused because she didn't recognize Devon or she was intimidated by her husband, or she was one half of her severed self. But she definitely didn't seem to be the same person. The premise of The Stepford Wives - that husbands would band together and have their wives turned into bland, compliant, robotic-like women - could be a reason for going public with severance. And just imagine how that might help parents deal with wayward toddlers and children. Sever the brain so that there would only be well-behaved children who never challenged their elders, toddlers that never had temper tantrums, babies who never cried. I think the baby goats (whom we already heard could make quite a ruckus when hungry) are test subjects for such an effort.\n\nOne by one, the MDR team has started to question what Lumon is doing. Helley didn't like it from the very beginning. Mark started to get curious after Petey showed up. Dylan now has a reason to be suspicious, having seen his son while he was an innie. Only Irving continues to spout Lumon crap. I would guess that over time, the attraction between Burt and Irving (almost said Ernie, LOL), is going to grow so strong that Irving will have to deviate from Lumon's handbook in order to avoid real cognitive dissonance. And once the fearsome four are in sync, I predict stuff is going to go wild. Of course, Dylan's change of heart depends on whether his Innie remembers what happened in the closet. I have a slight suspicion that the switch that turned Dylan's Innie on and off may also erase memories in which case this paragraph is null and void. \n\nThe items that O&amp;D have been creating - a hatchet and a watering can - are both related to trees/foliage which, coincidentally, are in the room that Burt considers his secret place. One destroys (or severs) and one nurtures. I keep thinking that nothing is coincidental in any of this. Various items are shown to the severed people and their reactions are observed. The basement is nothing more than a big behavioral laboratory. The fact that Milcheck rigged the copy machine so that Irving would see the picture of the coup and Corbal referred to it by a specific code# (as in an experimental treatment) makes me think that a lot of the other items thrown at the severed peeps are also experimental treatments. Lumon just wants to see what severance does to a person, given a variety of situations. I do think that there was a coup when something triggered one group to attach the other and those people were destroyed. However, the two teams are now being set up again to see if the latest version of whatever they stick into your brain has been improved to the point where that level of conflict doesn't occur.\n\nSo many more thoughts, but not enough energy to write everything down right now. Plus, I want to see what happens next week to see if those match up with any of these observations, before I offer anymore. I do think that Lumon has plans to take severance outside of the workplace. That may be where it started but there are a lot of other potential applications of severing a brain. What's to say that they are not examining multiple applications!",

There are women's shoes in the closet, mom isn't home when Milchek comes in, and sure, moms can be out with friends, grocery shopping, working, etc ...but I was widowed young with 3 kids, so I feel like I can add to the conversation. \n\n* I feel that Milchek would have made sure mom was there to keep the kid out of the way, if that was an option. \n\n*Dylan's outie would have protested having the boss knock him out with nobody to tend to his kid if Mom was just out. Single parents are often treated like children by others who wouldn't be that pushy to someone with a partner.\n\n* Sure, there could be women's shoes in the closet for a few reasons if he's divorced (kept them in secret because he isn't over her, he's into drag, etc) but it's more likely that he kept some of her stuff to remember her by. \n\n* No woman I've ever known, including myself, would just fail to notice if an ex kept or took her shoes when they split. \n\n* I think Dylan is struggling financially.  If he was still with his kid's mom, either they'd have 2 incomes, or she would stay with the kid while Dylan worked. Daycare as a solo parent is extremely expensive (it's expensive doe everyone, but even harder to handle alone.) \nWhy is he struggling financially? Did you see their TV?  It was an old cube, (or a fastback, as my kids say.) Even I can afford a regular, modern TV. Goodwill has them (and no cubes anymore.) Also, I've had kids' streaming and cable, so I know old cartoons like Felix the Cat are never on, and I've never seen them available on streaming services. It's likely a DVD or even a  vhs tape.\n\nI know these things sound like I could be reaching, but these types of shows are very deliberate.  Nothing is there for no reason. I could see Lumon as a very evil company, capable of murder when is benefits them. Either that, or they only like to work with people who have few friends or family members.\nThe only reason I used heteronormative suggestion is that Dylan has talked openly about having sex with MILFs.

Maybe she worked with this Reghadi, who actually escaped, but got caught. Lumon, rather than lose one of their assets or outright murder an employee, might have seen the value in a compromise - allow the innie to take over, giving her access to the outside world and power over other innies. Her shrine could be to her outie - the part of her that no longer exists so long as she doesn\u2019t let it. It would also explain her fervor for Kier - many innies have an almost religious reverence for Kier, as the only \u201cculture\u201d they had on the severance floor. Maybe she wants to reintegrate herself, or simply stop Reghadi (someone who truly rebelled and wants to reintegrate) from making it possible due to the fact she\u2019s shut her outie away for so long. This is a bit tinfoil, and I need to look deeper at the shrine itself, but I think it fits with a lot of the themes we\u2019ve seen! Also could explain why Corbel has a seemingly fraught relationship with the higher ups. And she did get a \u201cnew office\u201d recently\u2026 might not be relevant at all, but just a fun little tidbit to support it!",

They also didn\u2019t have much respect for the source material, George RR Martin, or the fans. HBO would have given them all the money they needed to finish the show properly, but they had gotten bored with it and wanted to move onto other projects.
