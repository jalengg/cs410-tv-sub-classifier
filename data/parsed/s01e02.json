I believe this due to her facial expressions but also the fact that she gives Mark conflicting stories about her mothers religiosity depending on which version she is talking to\n\n\\- I'm starting to think the \"employees\" are pre-selected on the outside and brought to Lumon for some significant reason we are yet to see. This could mean that some \"employees\" are more important than others and even that some are only needed for a short while such as Carol D whilst others they intend to keep forever. This is just a theory ofc\n\n\\- I got the impression that Irvs episode was caused by him nearly falling asleep. They seem to be very strict about nobody sleeping on the job. Could just be because they want them to be as productive as possible when sorting the numbers or it could be to do with the chip not working if you sleep at work\n\n\\-I'm very interested in their pay also. There is reference to Irv getting wages docked because of him nodding off but how would they explain that to his Outie? Also in cases such as Marks promotion this would surely involve a wage increase in the normal world but they have no reason to give him one as he doesn't even know about his own promotion. Whole thing seems a bum deal for the worker tbh - I doubt they have a great union either lol. They must have to be real desperate to sign up for the job but I suspect this will be touched on soon\n\n\\- As for the blue thing I haven't thought too much about it. They all seem to have outfits but thats not too unusual for an office job anyway. Would be interesting to see if they go anywhere with it",

If they can recall US states, and basic grammar rules, etc., where does it end?  If their outside self watched a movie in the outside a million times (allowing for some solid encoding to happen), can their inside self recall the events of the movie (not the experience of watching it, just the plot of the movie), or is that too personal?  A piece of media\u2019s plot is not inherently personal, but having seen vs. not seen it can contribute to personality and can tell someone about themselves.\n\nIt seems (based on the film and music facts given to Irving in the wellness room) that they can\u2019t remember things like media or current events.\n\nBut then how is that controlled for or differentiated without interfering with the rest of their (non-personal) semantic memories?",

I was always miserable at my jobs because it was never just about the work. And I wished that it was.

Being able ignore those things while in the other sounded very pleasing on the surface.\n\nThis is nothing like that but close enough hat I really empathize with people who choose to work there.

Or am I way off base? lol! I literally JUST saw it for the first time\u2026of course it\u2019s cued now!

Of course that's true, but it's also a weird and specific thing to draw attention to. Is it some weird test of his memory as an \"outie\" (remembering that garbage is one day and recycling the next)? Or foreshadowing about what's going wrong in the world: that it's related to garbage/pollution? That could also tie into the black goo, focus on water, the greenhouse, etc. \n\nIrving's weirdness definitely goes beyond simply being older and falling asleep. There's obviously the black goo, but also the way he immediately tried to do a trust fall at the welcome party. I'm thinking severance really has a negative impact long term, and is affecting Irving because he's been working there the longest. \n\nI've also been thinking about the idea of \"re-severance\", that if something isn't working out with an \"innie\" or they need to transfer departments or something, they might \"kill\" the current innie and start everything all over again. That's not what happened with Mark, because we have info about when he started to work at the company, but could be the case for someone like Irving. \n\nLastly, what the hell was up with Irving's outie allegedly liking the sound of radar? This could be another clue about their work. But in general, some of the terms being used are very strange, either outdated or just uncommon.",

Those memories would not register in any capacity in the Innie's consciousness.\n\nI think there is some suspension of disbelief required. The implant is already sci-fi, so it's not a big stretch to assume that it's smart enough to differentiate between personally-identifiable memories and general memories.\n\nBased on the sea theory, the Innies don't even know the state of society. That means they don't have certain specific memories at all, such as what movies were released just before their Severance. I assume that, at the point of Severance, the implant compares the individual's memories to some pre-determined encyclopedia of general knowledge. A list of the states, what an ocean is, the English language, etc. are all retained because those memories match a database, and the implant only pulls those memories when forming the new Innie consciousness.",

For example, observers often fail to notice major differences introduced into an image while it flickers off and on again. People's poor ability to detect changes has been argued to reflect fundamental limitations of human attention. Change blindness has become a highly researched topic and some have argued that it may have important practical implications in areas such as eyewitness testimony and distractions while driving.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

Any personally-identifiable memories do not transfer over to the Innie, which would mean anything about your family, your preferences, non-general knowledge like how to make specific carpentry joints, etc.\n\nMy current theory is that the company has designed a complete tabula rasa consciousness that isn't formed from *any* of the host's original memories. This consciousness is implanted into the worker's brain to form the start of their Innie identity.\n\nImagine that a serial murderer is captured by the police. He says that he will continue killing the second he gets a chance. He has no hopes of rehabilitation. If you could just wipe his identity and have him start over as a functioning adult, wouldn't that be in the best interest of everyone? You'd turn him from a hopeless criminal to a functioning member of society who can learn to be happy and make others happy.\n\nIn fact, the whole experiment could be to form the best blank slate for resetting the identity of an adult. The numbers, the break room, the rehab... it could all be designed to study the tabula rasa consciousness in order to refine it. Even the way that they have you wake up is utterly bizarre - why would they spread you out on a table? Why would they wait so long to show you the video of your Outie consenting? It's all clearly designed as a test.\n\nThere's also a bit of foreshadowing about this when it was pointed out that Helly's Innie would essentially die if she quit for good; conversely, an Outie can also die if it is permanently replaced by an Innie.\n\nThe theme of death was also revisited by Milchick, when he stated that no one dies there in the office. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but the implication is that death is something that happens to Outies, not Innies.\n\nFinally, Mark hints at this theme a little when he mentions that maybe the point of Severance is to not have to live your normal life for eight hours a day. Mark is depressed and possibly suicidal over the death of his wife. His Innie is much happier. Who's to say that Mark's Innie doesn't merit life just as much if not more than his Outie?\n\n(Sorry for the long rant. I could talk about this show for hours. It's incredible how complex the themes are for only two episodes!)",

I think the stairwell is one such boundary, and what we were seeing was only from the perspective of the 'innie'. In other words the innie walks through the stairwell and becomes the outie. The outie then makes the decision to walk back in, and then the innie resumes consciousness, and to them they never perceived the stairwell at all.

You can tell that Mark is pretty tortured by the death of his wife, and he literally avoids changing his light bulb because he dreads having to sort through his wife's belongings.\n\nAlso Mark's innie was saying he gets motivation from thinking about the effects of sleep, even though he didn't experience it.

But it seems like self-awareness in that way is absent as seen in the ball-rolling exercise in the first episode.  They didn't seem to be able to reveal much about themselves.  Of course, maybe that just didn't WANT to reveal this information.  But it seemed to me they just didn't know anything about themselves to share.",
