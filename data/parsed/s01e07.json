In that case close monitoring at the beginning would be enough. But I don't think that scenario is very likely. Lumon can't monitor the outies and the chance that they'll bring some information to their innies from home is way, way, way too big. It wouldn't have to be subversive or malicious: just a photo of a child or a spouse they forgot to remove from the back pocket would be enough to completely disrupt innies' reality.",

I'm glad he told immediately others about his kid, great moment (I cried during that scene and also seeing Irv broken).

I can\u2019t stop thinking about what Reghabi told Mark:\n\n&gt; \u201cMaybe he loves it, you\u2019re right. Or maybe he doesn\u2019t. Maybe he dreams every day of clawing his way to the surface. But you wouldn\u2019t know, you\u2019ll never know. You brought him into this world without his permission based on your own desire for emotional convenience.\u201d\n\nThe rich are thoroughly insulated from the poor. They can go their whole day without seeing a poor person (that isn\u2019t serving them) if they so choose. I don\u2019t just mean the ultra-rich, either. Even middle class Westerners, even though we don\u2019t think of ourselves as rich, never have to see the people who manufacture the abundant commodities that make our lives comfortable. We don\u2019t even need to think about them as people. Recall Helly\u2019s outie, \u201cI am a person and you are not.\u201d We Sever\u2122 ourselves from the people whose labor makes our lives possible. People who are fundamentally ourselves except for that they are denied their humanity and coerced into working their lives away so that we may self-actualize and bask in the fruits of their labor.",

Milchick is excited about Helly joining the team in a very specific way - calling it a \"miracle\" and stuff. Clearly, she's someone important. Then, when MDR go to that museum of Eagan, she seems to sort of connect with the Eagan statues (and, as others have noted, she does look like she could be related to them). Those things, paired with the fact she is *heavily* trying to escape and clearly won't ever be comfortable with her position, indicate she's someone who isn't used to working, and is probably used to being in a position of power (unlike the SVR'D floor where she's powerless).

There is no way that Cobel won't cancel his card immediately now that he is known to be dead.\n\nIt would seem that their security is bogus to a large degree because at this point, were no one to review the video feed of who used his card that day when he possibly couldn't have that would be a serious omission.  Hopefully all will be revealed, but it doesn't seem possible that they could really care (do?) so little about security and attempt to get away with what they have been doing.  Obviously, it all seems to be falling apart now, but we know Severance has been happening for at least 7 years (Burt) or more?  I can't believe that they don't have an actionable security framework in place so that it lasted this long.\n\nI hope this isn't just the writing falling apart at the end and all will make sense when revealed.  I do enjoy the show, but not sure if multiple seasons of it will hold up unless the rabbit hole is revealed to be much bigger than expected.",

He keeps running around over to O &amp; D to flirt and cannot keep his concentration on his work. \n\nDylan = Dread. He was deeply afraid / anxious about the O &amp; D department / Burt because of the coup. \n\nI think this is relevant because of Keir\u2019s taming the four tempers idea. I suspect that whatever they are doing on the computers is, in effect, taming themselves (perhaps deleting memories). When we first met Irving, he was the opposite of frolic. He was very by the book. I think he had been there for so long that the \u201ctaming\u201d was nearly complete. However, meeting Burt changed that and he resorted back to his \u201cfrolicy\u201d ways. \n\nIdk, this is probably waaaay off.

It's not her fault that Petey started to push back, and it wasn't her fault that he was able to reintegrate. But the board continues to claim that reintegration cannot happen. I'd be aggravated, too, if people kept insisting something worked when I could see that it wasn't working. On the other hand, it's possible Harmony has been held back by her explosive anger. She's not exactly pleasant to be around, except when she's Mrs. Selvidge. I never know whether her concern about Mark is genuine or whether it's an act to allow her to get closer to and keep an eye on his outtie.",

Helly R. was told by her outtie that she had no control over her own fate; the outtie would not let her leave. Mark has come to the conclusion that he really was Petey's good friend and Petey died trying to reintegrate. (While we know Ms. Casey is Gemma, Mark's outtie won't recognize Ms. Casey so that's not what's driving innie Mark to rebel at this point). Dylan now knows he has a son but Milchek (representing Lumon) won't tell him the kid's name. Finally, Irving has lost his love, Burt, believing that innie Burt is being murdered as punishment for having developed a relationship with Irving. They're all festering inside and are ripe to push back. My guess is that this isn't the first time the Lumon implant \"experiments' have failed. Something always gets messed up and the innies revolt. Maybe Cobel has been around for a few of these and that's why she's getting angrier and angrier from week to week because she's noticing that it's starting to happen again (hence the lockdown). Personally, I would think she would totally lose her shit if/when she realizes that Milchek has been involved with each of these screw-ups except for Mark. He was unable to get Helly R. to accept things, he was responsible for Dylan seeing his son and he wasn't able to control the Burt &amp; Irving (I still want to say Bert &amp; Ernie) relationship so chose to retire outtie Burt/murder innie Burt. I have no doubt that something he does is going to push Mark even harder.",

Nobody could ever go back to innie life after experiencing a taste of the outside.\n\nI felt so bad for Irving in this episode. Burt barely showed him any affection even though it is the last time they will see each other. But clearly this was the push Irving needed to finally stop taking orders from Milchick. \"You smug motherfucker.\" \"Let's burn this place to the ground.\" Love it!\n\nThe Mark/Ms. Casey connection really shows how nefarious Lumon is. Gemma didn't die from the accident and is instead being employed at Lumon full time as an innie who can never leave. It's no wonder she seems so robotic, she's been stuck there for the past two years. Now I feel so bad for all the times Mark and Ms. Casey had interactions in the past, with no idea of all the history they shared.\n\nI can't wait for the revelations of the next episode, but I just know it's going to end on a huge cliffhanger that is going to blow all our minds. Especially after Servant's season 3 finale tonight, I don't know how much more my heart can take.",

Cobel says as much when she says \"we serve Kier, you child!\" The fact that Lumon started with \"topical salves\" is another hint here - it reminds me of multilevel marketing companies like Amway, which just sell meaningless bullshit like health products and protein bars as an arbitrary means of income generation, when the real goal is to run a pyramid scheme.",

The way his outie spoke of (speculated, really) about the happiness his innie felt came off like he resented not having that same experience outside of work. That happiness is purely theoretical to his outie, whereas his innie has the privilege of actually experiencing it. His whole goodbye message was tinged with a sense of longing and irony - there was a sort of bleak comedy to the way he had to keep adding caveats to his statements since he didn't actually know what his innie was up to. Christopher Walken did a beautiful job conveying so much in just that brief, grainy footage.",

In the intro to the show it shows him piloting himself like a mech. That kind of sparked the idea. That and Alexa's character makes me nervous. Could just be paranoia but I don't think Lumon would allow the relationship to even come to fruition if there wasn't some agenda or they felt it might hinder his work. His reason for signing up for the job was to escape the reality of his wife dying. Maybe it's their way of keeping him emotionally stable enough to continue his work. At the same time you'd think they wouldn't want him to have a love interest as it would negate his reason for taking the job. Idk.",

But realistically, from Mark's perspective, we ought to consider whether he should have immediately gone to the cops.  Setting aside what's right and wrong in the larger sense, would that have been the safest move for him?  Or was he already caught up so deep that it would just inevitably lead at some point to a \"tragic accident\" befalling him?\n\nSeemed a little strange that Hellie was so cheerful.\n\n\"Oh yeah?  Want to go talk to her together?\"  Nice.  Well played, Dylan.\n\nThis jailbreak is exciting, but it's also kind of crazy.  I guess the risk is less for the innies since they are just imprisoned there all the time anyway (although if they get fired it means they effectively die), but I just don't see how Mark thought he could bring the passcard of the recently murdered security guy into work without it being extremely risky for him.  He's lucky Harmony wasn't watching the security cameras from her office monitor.\n\nSpeaking of risky, Mark keeps making me nervous by putting stuff in his own trash bin. First the flip phone and now the clothing.  He should have burned that somewhere or at least dumped it in a random dumpster.\n\nGreat Billie Holiday needle drop at the end. Used extremely effectively in conjunction with the cinematography of his tape job and reveal.",

This was probably forced upon Burt's outtie, by saying something like his job had been completed.\n\n\"Retirement\" at Lumon is essentially a bloodless way to kill off a troubling worker. If that worker never shows up again, it's the same as if that innie is dead. (I guess it could happen in two ways: retirement, where it is announced ahead of time to the innie's colleagues, and they celebrate it, which keeps morale up; or by firing, preventing the outtie from coming back to work, and would not be announced ahead of time, leaving the innie's colleagues wondering what happened. This is probably less preferable, since it might disrupt the work flow, so they probably try to have retirements happen, and ask the outtie to record a retirement video.",

I know they try to explain but it can never really work. You remember your vocabulary well enough to have relatively complex conversations in English but not your own kid's name? Nope. That's never gonna make sense. Some words we learn are connected to people, places, events, sounds, smells.

      "body": "It's probably not ordered from least mentioned to most (most of these are pretty heavily mentioned I think), but here you go. My taste is clich\u00e9d, lol.\n\n**The Double** (film) - my absolute favourite film, check out the trailer and you'll note the immediate similarities. There's *loads* of them. The Richard Ayoade one starring Jesse Eisenberg.\n\n**The Good Place** (TV show) - Adam Scott is also in it, but that isn't actually why I'm mentioning it. I just think it's got a lot in common with Severance: lots of mysteries and questions that get slowly revealed over the course of the show, you have a central team of four thrust into an environment they're unfamiliar with as they try and overthrow the existing system, plot twists, ethical quandaries, etc (you even have a main character choosing to forget everything, much someone who is severed). Severance is a show about what hell could be, and The Good Place also offers a version of the afterlife.\n\n**The Leftovers** (TV show) - Lost gets compared to this show a hell of a lot, but I'll be honest, I haven't actually seen it all. I have seen all of The Leftovers, however, and it is also a bit of a mystery box show with interesting ideas about what it is to be alive, also made by Damon Lindelof. There's also a lot of identity-based stuff. I think Severance will begin to tackle the idea of religion a little more head-on over time, and The Leftovers does this too. Also, Kevin seems to be \"chosen\" in a similar way to Mark - what is so special about Mark? I guess we'll find out. I think The Leftovers is a bit different though in that it doesn't really try to answer the questions it poses. I hope that Severance *will* answer the questions.\n\n**Russian Doll** (TV show) - you have a character who is trapped, powerless, and unable to get out of their situation, much like the innies. There's an interesting mystery, too. Tonally it's very different, but I don't know, it reminds me of Severance a bit.\n\n**Mr Robot** (TV show) - another show that was filled to the brim with interesting plot twists (some being fairly similar to what's in Severance, though I won't spoil anything). Also fairly mind-bendy.\n\n**Maniac** (miniseries) - the retro-futurism, the mysterious scientific company, the questions of identity shown through trippy visuals... there's a lot in common with Severance. If you like one, I'd be surprised if you don't like the other.\n\n**Ex Machina** (film) - mentioned already. Duh.\n\n**Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind** (film) - obvious pick is obvious, but there's incredibly similar themes. The rest of Charlie Kaufman/Spike Jonze's work also bears similarity to Severance in my opinion (Being John Malkovich is probably the second most similar film of theirs), though their stuff is usually a tad more abstract. The mind-bendiness, mostly.\n\nThere's definitely other shows and films I'm completely blanking on, but these are some of the main shows and films I love that I think can be compared to Severance.\n\nI also want to say that I personally wrote a television pilot that was about a company hiring people to do content moderation (the main character of my pilot also lost his long-term girlfriend, which was the motivator for him deciding to work at the fairly traumatic job). There was a whole conspiracy that's later revealed too - the company intentionally finds people who are grieving, preys on them, and manipulates them into working, then when they're at the job they're ground down into further submission etc. I was actually really proud of the pilot, but Severance has executed the ideas I wanted to execute *much* better than I ever could've executed them. On one hand, that's incredibly annoying and makes me feel like a bit of a failure as a writer, but on the other, it means Severance feels genuinely tailor-made for my tastes.",

The Good Place though ... is my absolute favorite comfort show, so smart, and funny, and warm, and yet a completely dystopian nightmare, lol.  \n\nThe only things I haven't seen from your list I have at least started.  Mr. Robot and The Leftovers, I don't know, I lost interest a few episodes in on each, idk what makes them different.  I either should try them again or there's a subtley in taste that divides.  \n\nYou're probably completely familiar but on the off chance I'd recommend anyone with similar tastes who hasn't already ... check out the Benson and Morehead efforts, specifically The Endless and Resolution, and the Zal and Brit efforts, specifically Another Earth and Sound of My Voice, though it would be silly to sleep on The OA.

I have not seen a failure yet.\n\nThe issue is that if Lumon had perfect control of everything it would take years to get around said controls. So we have to assume Lumon's failures are possible. One hint was Mark saying how little effort you have to spend to control people once you figure out fear will do a lot of the job for free. So their failures are justifiable given how corporations operate, I can add a fan fiction meeting where they decide three people are enough to control the departments and how expensive is everything so minimizing employee count becomes important to the bean counters.\n\nGiven how pride plays a role in the demise of the powerful, you can imagine Lumon making stupid errors as they overestimate their power and intelligence. The sloppiness seen so far can fall under many explanations: Lumon cost cutting their employee count and counting on fear limiting the innies, Milchick and Cobel look happy from the outside but we have not seen a lot of them yet (the scarcity of episodes helps to keep things mysterious). \n\nMilchick panicked because of the card and tried to solve the issue behind Cobel's back. That looks correct if you assume that they don't have a close relationship and maybe even Milchick fears Cobel (Milchick may have been a visitor to the Break Room for non severed). Cobel is also distracted by her spying on Devon ops so the innies get a chance to get to the security room and they'll probably make it back to MDR. \n\nThis is a random thought, but maybe the reason the tech in the basement is low is a way to suggest that in this world there is not a lot of automated AI stuff that Lumon could use to cut costs and when there is no one to check the monitors the innies are pretty much free roam chickens. This is also an artistic choice, but it helps to explain why Lumon is not Sauron. I love that the switches they use to turn on/off the innies are so retro BTW.",

This fits into my theory that she's an older person who's been implanted into a different, younger body.\n* I'm wondering if we'll see Helly at the Eagan Family Retreat.\n* When Cobel whispered about reintegration proof at first I thought she was like \"hey Natalie reintegration is possible\"  but then I realized she was talking close to her earpiece microphone.. to the board.  But I wonder if this is sort of a clue that employees like Cobel, Natalie, and Graner secretly want it to be possible because they feel trapped there or something.  Like when Graner suggested they celebrate when they had proof of Petey reintegrating.   Or maybe just to prove to the high and mighty Board that they're wrong.  Maybe reintegration is part of what the cult side of Lumon perceives to be Kier's final vision or something.  And for whatever reason this goes against the corporate side of Lumon.\n* During the scene where Mark picks up the ripped photo \"I'll be seeing you, in all the familiar places\" was totally a clue that we're going to probably recognize who we're gonna see in the pic.  Also Cobel asks Devon if he thinks he sees her like she saw her dead husband.\n* During the ripped photo scene he's reciting things he likes about his wife exactly like it's being read to him in the Wellness Center.  Then he says he loves these things \"equally\"  it's like they were getting our brains prepared for it to be Ms. Casey.\n* I was waiting for the scene of Mark taping the photo to change to Dylan at Lumon after hours hitting the switch and for Mark to switch to his innie and see a photo of Ms. Casey on his table and be like What the fuckity fuck?  Then Dylan get spooked and quickly switch it off.  I guess this could still happen... not exactly but I think Mark might end up displaying a proper photo of her and when they eventually to the OTC on him he will see Ms. Casey and equally freak out. Now the question is... is Gemma still in there somewhere?\n\nThere's a ton of other zingers this episode but this is what I jotted down.",

They revolt, thus giving some credence to the painting and these whispered stories of violence. We see even the most compliant in Irv finally snap in this episode... it's like a cycle that, no matter what management does, is doomed to repeat. The severed's reality is just too hopeless, no matter what trivial gifts they receive.\n\nAlso, Milchick is really creating alot of problems for management... first the book that he left in the open, then using OTC which broke Dylan.

Is it future Mark doing some sort of call back to his time inside and working with Gemma in wellness but not knowing at the time it was her?

The numbers they are choosing are entirely random; they're there to provoke the stress and Corbel and Milchick are constantly watching to see what they do. I'm speculating that the work, developing the implant has gone on for years and Lumon hasn't gotten it right, yet. The severed refiners eventually start to figure out what's going on, get worked up, and want to push back. Eventually, there's mayhem and possibly murder. So, the implant is tweaked and the cycle starts all over again but it looks as if there's going to be another fail. Eventually, Lumon hopes to get it right. But now, they've got the issue of reintegration to contend with. Until they can figure out how to keep the severed workers' focus on their work life, there's the potential that somebody's outtie may influence their innie and the rebellious feelinga will start anew. The newest theory, that some of those innies don't even have outies and live in Lumon (Gemma), would be one way to eliminate that outside influence and keep the worker bees focused on the hive. Plus, the idea that Irving might be living in a grave (dirt under his fingernails; Petey's map reference) adds credence to the idea that Lumon is experimenting on dead people and are implanting corpses). These same implants could also be used to keep the Eagan family members alive which explains some other questions expressed in these posts.",

Lumon WANTED them to bond only to take irving away so they can make Burt and Irving meet on the outside and see if they remember anything - basically the reverse of my theory about Mark and Gemma being married then put in Lumon/severed to see if they'd reconnect (kinda like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind)  \n3.) the least likely/most interesting imo - what if they retired Burt because he just happened to have gotten to the point where his 'implant learned' how to do the job it was required for and can now be implanted into literal livestock turning 'Burt' into a Goat named Burt that can do some simple process thats now engrained in it...  \n\n\ni know this last theory about the livestock is real otut there but maybe yall can build on it...keen to hear others thoughts!",

      "body": "Let me take a stab at building/further explaining a few of your observations. \n\nThe reason that Harmony Corbel seems so old is because she is. I think Harmony Cobel is actually Charlotte Cobel but she has an implant, possibly in a younger body. Charlotte's DOB was in the shrine in Mrs. Selvidge's house. At the time, everybody said that Harmony couldn't possibly be the same person. But I think she is. Or her implant is. I do think she's directly related to the Eagan's, either by blood or by association. She's been entrusted to manage the severed workers but she's been having problems - one coup, then a reintegration, now, the potential for a second coup. She's a very angry frustrated person at work. At home, she is more caring, worrying about Mark as she eats milk and cookies at night and spies on him. Comments have been made that the innies are more infantile. But Corbel has the opposite experience; her outtie is the more childlike one. \n\nCorbel was also in on the plan to implant Gemma, Mark's \"dead\" wife who may or may not be actually dead. That's why she keeps a close eye on Mark, to make sure he doesn't remember anything, but also worried because Mark seems so sad a lot of the time. It's not clear whether she has enough empathy to recognize what Petey did: \"You carry the hurt down there with you. You just don\u2019t know what it is.\" There have been a few hints in the storyline suggesting that some of the innies may have died but are being kept alive at work via the implant. But these people are innies, only; they have no outie. Gemma would be one. Irving had dirt underneath his finger nails this week. Could he have literally risen from the dead? This is also supported by Petey's map and comments he made to Mark when he stayed over at Mark's house.\n\nI believe Helly is going to show up at the Eagan Family Gala. The subtle hints that she may be somebody special and the possible likeness to the statues of some of the Eagans make it seem like she's related to the family. \n\nMy predictions for the rest of this season: We already know that episode 8 involves a dinner party thrown by Rickert and Devon (preview paragraph on Apple+). I think we'll get some more info on Gemma and Mark's relationship and what actually happened to Gemma. I do not believe Rickert has anything to do with the Eagans; if he does, he'd be a black sheep with his management theories. Episode 9, the final one of season 1 will be focused primarily on  the Family Gala. Something big is going to happen there. I'm betting it's the reveal that Helly is an Eagan. That will be the cliff hanger that will carry us into the next season. Somewhere between 8 and 9, we're going to get some more insight into Irving and possibly learn why he had dirt under his nails. That seems like an important detail. Mark is also going to become more curious about the reintegration process, possibly because of something he learns from Rickert, and may return to the university.",

Petey\u2019s phone and now the clothes. The clothes HAVE to come back and bite him. \n\n\nMarks\u2019s outtie isn\u2019t progressing in any direction (as compared to his innie\u2019s growth). If anything, his outtie is worse now than at the beginning. Interesting to see the parallel that the more unhappy his innie gets, the worse off his outtie is. Don\u2019t know exactly what to make of it. I think his outtie probably truly wants to stay severed thinking it\u2019s for the best. Maybe he\u2019ll betray the MDR team at the end. \n\n\nIt just struck me that being severed is a terrible way to deal with trauma. You think you\u2019ll get 8 hours of time off thinking about your pain but you don\u2019t. You essentially create another person and all the time that YOU have as an outtie is still 100% grieving. If anything, it\u2019s probably worse because sometimes work can offer a welcome distraction and the outtie persona isn\u2019t getting that.\n\nThis show is quickly becoming my favorite.",

      "body": "I'm so excited. And no longer worried about the show. This episode opens with the first feet of central-plot progress I've felt in what feels like forever, like since Petey died, and there's so much of it. I crossed my fingers they weren't bluffing again with Graner's card. Bluffs like the map the protagonist rips up and throws away, or the cellphone he deactivates and tosses in the trash\u2014when it's an unmotivated main character that keeps grinding on breaks to keep the plot from going places, I worry they don't have enough to say to meet their runtime. Leaving the silver haired Cobel gone rogue in a fake-moustache to nose around for filler content in her spare time. As a neighbour or a nurse.  \nI fking loved how they changed the characters. Showing Dylan home with his family. Activated. Inspiring his change from the contented employee with achievement perks to a rat in a cage. The writers are mining all this gold I've been waiting for. And Irving facing Burt's departure to set him off.  \nI've been feeling claustrophobic with most of the hallways stuff lately\u2014apart from Burt romance\u2014and frustrated that the pregnant sister's even had her own mic at all. The tiny trickle of substance in her storyline could've easily fit within the bounds of the main character's POV\u2014give us glimpses of her when he visits. But here are hints of this paying off.  \nA rich woman severed to spare herself the effort of raising children. This line totally confused me for a moment. I thought the sister's moral compass had been thrown under the bus to flatten the complexity of the severance dilemma into \"I wonder if I could sever an office personality just to make my baby for me\" (not an actual quote). Like who would have this random thought about wanting to forget giving birth or nursing etc? But of course she's talking about the rich woman forgetting her face. So there's severance for the super rich.  \nAll still pretty peripheral to a plot full of more compelling things to say, but as long as there's meat in an episode I don't mind.  \nAnd finally something juicy parts with the grey lady. Getting in the secretary's face. Good stuff.  \nI might be tripping balls here but the idea that the ending plot twist means his wife is the dead-half of a therapist's severed brain is battling my eyesight's problem that she looks....white? in the photo? Is that her? Am I blind? I mean it must be, for all the slow-rolling that THUMB did on the photo.  \nAnd now that the whole show is going to splinter into\u2014this is a prediction\u2014these freaked out double lives on the outside, saving Burt's existence and placing Mark in the uncomfortable position of playing it cool that his boss is his neighbour (NOTE TO OUTSIDE MARK, GREY NEIGHBOUR IS A SPY, SINCERELY, OFFICE MARK) the show can go fking anywhere. So many tools at their disposal.  \nNo surprise this episode has a 9.0 on IMDB, compared the the 7.0 on a recent episode I was whining about.",

Kier \u201cand his progeny\u201d not his descendants. Harmony\u2019s very old fashioned name and manner of dress. All three of them having those sort of jarring mid-Atlantic accents. \u201cNurse\u201d Solveg referencing Clark Gable as a dreamboat. Her freaking candlelit shrine and obsession with lavender.\nI\u2019d argue she\u2019s older than the men\u2014based on the men\u2019s clothes, I\u2019d say they were born in the 1920s and started with Lumon during WWII\u2014maybe they had to be closeted in their outie life and only their relatively young innies lack the social strictures against same sex love. I think Harmony is a straight up pioneer days Kier acolyte, zealous for 150 years.\nMaybe the Board is just a bunch of heads in jars or some crazy something.\nAnyway, what do y\u2019all think?",

Take a man who was very much in love and had his wife taken away from him before her time - sever him - then put in him the basement \\*with his wife\\* and see if either of them every could possibly recognize each other. If they don't recognize each other that's the ultimate proof of concept for severance - the ultimate success.\n\nMark is the stable release version of severance that the board of Lumen uses to market their tech to the military, the CIA, the government, and the wealthy elite probably.",

(There are no cellphones or iPods in Eternal Sunshine, it is mainly cassette tapes in cars or answering machines, and the computing is in Courier Bold.) The big point that Eternal Sunshine makes is that you can't erase specific memories without taking away big memories, because it's all connected. \n\nThat's not the conceit here, at least not so far, but we seem to be heading to somewhere where an innie granted privileges beyond the severance floor can become a kind of imposter outie, and that's Lacunae territory.",

The Leftovers especially - season 1 is the worst season, and season 2 tonally reinvents the show and makes it more bright and more surreal. (The Leftovers S1 is an adaptation of a book, the later seasons are wholly original.)\n\nI don\u2019t know how far into Mr Robot you got, but the last few episodes of season 1 also completely redefine what the show is about. I think it\u2019s worth trying both again \u2014 Mr Robot and The Leftovers are two of my all-time favourite finales, and they both contain a few episodes that I\u2019d argue are up there with the absolute best of what television has to offer. Mr Robot in particular experiments a hell of a lot with its episodes (it has an episode styled like a sitcom, one with no dialogue, one that\u2019s staged like a play, one that is made to look like one take, etc). \n\nI actually haven\u2019t seen the majority of your recommendations (though I\u2019m familiar with most of them), so you\u2019ve given me a lot to watch!

You can see that there is a part of him that does not want to follow the trail and expose what ever is happening in there. Maybe a part of him takes comfort in the fact that some part of him has a chance to see her.\n\nI think it would also explain why Cobel is taking such a special interest in him. I don't think Lumon has trouble getting people into their procedure. You can sort of gauge that from the book. They especially don't need to steal a dead body or fake a death or do anything sinister like that. It seems like an unnecessary risk.\n\nI think we are in for a showdown between Mark (inie) who wants to help the others to bring down Lumon and Mark (outie) who will want to just keep his wife alive. \n\nI think it will be one of those 'let her go' type of situations.",

Same way Burt\u2019s innie essentially dies when outie Burt retires. Outie Mark doesn\u2019t remember these details because there is obviously more to severance then originally explained. ie the rich pregnant lady, remote switching on of innies, some kind of \u2018elephant protocol\u2019 seen on one of the pages in the security handbook when Helly and Mark are in the security room to obtain the overtime protocol instructions. Mark chose to join the severance program at Lumon to find his wife.

      "body": "Michick, Cobel, and Graner (now deceased of course unless somehow that brutal head bashing didn't kill him) are either permanent innies or permanent outties. Hard to tell still. They are all aware of the override switches but there's a chance their innies decided they loved the company more and don't care if they kill off their outtie just as an outtie often isn't thinking about their innie.  \n\nI went over the control room scene slowly and picked up a few interesting things. \n\n1. We can get an idea of the number of departments and employees, they are all just coded in 2-3 letters. \n\n2. In some of the closeups, there are a few that are on the red LED. It's possible this changes based on if they are at work or not OR it has to do with the innie overriding the outtie full time. The latter seems more likely as the red is under the name BYPASS EMERGENCY while green is under BYPASS NORMAL. None in MDR were set to red. \n\n3. I couldn't see a close-up showing LEDs for Milchick or Cobel. But there is a Harmony S. and James M. Harmony as Mark's next door neighbor is referred to as Mrs. Selvig, so decent chance they're the same. \n\n4. On the elevator screen, the elevator is divided into 2 sections, NON-SEVERED (left) and SEVERED (right). Harmony Cobel was on the NON-SEVERED side when she was shown descending. If this division has to do with who is severed or not, this either shows she is a permanent outtie and never severed, she was severed but only uses it for some unique situations like the woman who uses it for child birth but otherwise is the same person both as the neighbor / nurse outside and Cobel inside Lumon, or she was severed but the innie overrode the outtie (so technically not split between the 2 anymore and wouldn't show up that way, and the BYPASS EMERGENCY/red could mean she's permanent innie). \n\n5. It's possible Harmony Cobel is the same person as Harmony S. on the D&amp;R portion of the portion of the scene I mentioned in #2 above, where the LED is red. D&amp;R likely stands for Disposal and Reclamation, which was shown on a wall label in a scene in a previous episode. \n\n6. The floors are marked as followers (top to bottom): 12 MACHINE, 11 EXEC. STE, 10 SR. STE, 9 CONF. ROOM, 8 CONF. ROOM, 7 IT, 6 ACO., 5 DATA P., 4 NET.SYS. Although not visible on the screen, it appears the 3 non-visible floors below the 4th (possibly more if there are also basement floors) are SEVERED, MEZZ, and ENTRANCE based on the departing and destination floors 3 of the elevators show. \n\n7. 13 is unmarked. \n\n8. On the SEVERED side, floors 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 have a mysterious icon in the top right corner of the floor name box. My hunch is indicates the floors that SEVERED have access to. These icons are not present at all on the NON-SEVERED side (assuming they have access to all floors). \n\n9. In the protocol book Helly grabs, the page titles shown in order are: CLEAN SLATE CYCLE, ELEPHANT ACCESS CIRCUIT, BRANCH TRANSFER SYSTEM, OVERTIME CONTINGENCY PROTOCOL (one she rips out).",

Even the use of music.\n\nWhen the photo was revealed I thought it was going to be Helly.  I still think that makes more sense.  \n\nPersonal theory- they are downloading people's consciousness into babies / experimenting with babies.  \n\nI also think they can sever people in the real world.  Why can't the inner life be the real life?  Wouldn't that be a better selling point?  Telling people your life sucks but if you get this severance procedure for eight hours a day you will get your dream life.  Then they just sit people in a chair for 8 hours a day.  \n\nFinal thought- Severance=Heroin\n\nWhy is Severance such a big deal for the outie?  If they don't want to be severed then just don't show up to work / don't go down the elevator.  How is this permanent?  \n\nWell this is the same thing people tell drug addicts,  just don't do it.\n\nThis is also why even if you told your outie that life was hell as an innie they wouldn't care.

Some of the tasks we\u2019ve seen (raising baby goats/ the self defense cards, O&amp;D making hatchets and water cans) seem like obvious doomsday prep activities. But the severed floor is actually a test chamber to test the indoctrination methods they use\u2014 there\u2019s a lot of infantilization, treating the employees as children. This is because eventually they plan to raise actual children like this, so they are trying to see what the long term effects/ likelihood of rebellion are/ if they can brainwash people into doing the tasks that need to be done. Easier to do this with adults who already know how to speak and walk and do tasks, but are otherwise blank slates. And when the end times come (or Lumon kicks them off), for the current adult population, they plan to sever them in order to indoctrinate them quickly into following kier. My other side theory is that Alexa is a Lumon plant and that selvig, for some reason, really wants mark to have a kid\u2014 so she can raise it inside Lumon? I think Gemma might have fertility issues, since mark said they were trying for kids but it never worked, so selvig split them up through faking their deaths, so each thinks the other is dead and they chose to sever to deal with the grief. Selvig was so interested in marks dating life in the first few episodes, and she is making moves to be close to his niece as well. In the first ep she tells him \u2018you\u2019re good people\u2019 or something and I wonder if she means something more by that. I don\u2019t know, I just think this whole thing feels like an experiment is being done on the employees, mark especially since he is so surveilled all the time!",

This would give someone trying to control the severed's emotions a blank canvas. \n\nWe know that it takes a while to be able to \"feel\" the numbers, this could be due to the adjustment period. We know Helly was \\*Pissed\\* constantly when she first started and thus couldn't be emotionally controlled easily. \n\nIn the last episode we see the security room with dials next to each person's name.

Just a tiny detail I caught on E06 'Hide and Seek:' After Mark passes Ms. Casey in the hall to the Break Room, it cuts to a scene in which he is having dinner with Alexa (we notice his knuckle is red). When the waiter tends to the couple, Mark says, \"I'm good with water, thank you.\" This is one of the few instances in which Mark turns-down an opportunity to drink alcohol. Per the scene cut, I wonder if Mark's brief run-in with Ms. Casey/Gemma on the Severed Floor had a contribution to his Outie's decision to remain sober for the moment.\n\nP.S. Tramell Tillman is the true hidden gem in this show.",

It's true that we also haven't Irv's outie personality, but his story is clearly aiming at personal relationships- the question there is mostly the relation his outie has with Bert's outie, if any. It really is fairly obvious that Helly is an Eagan- it's really the only way to actually tie threads together at the end of the season- there are only two episodes left, her outside of work persona has to already be relevant to the plot in some way. What would you do if you're wrong about this? Can you commit to a crazy act in typical reddit fashion like eating a hat if you're wrong or undergoing severance?",

Years (or decades) ago they were  severed and their outies/original selves haven't seen the light of day since. Throughout  this time Lumon has indoctrinated these versions of them into  model employees that buy 100% into the Kier cult of personality, which would explain why they appear to not be severed, as Irving accuses. In reality they are severed, and the innie versions of themselves are activated perpetually. This would also explain why they're such weirdos. Just a theory, but one I'm pretty bought in to.",

It has to somehow keep two separate memory states (innie and outie) on a single brain. We don't know if it \"forces\" the brain neuronal pathways to re-wire by sending certain electric impulses or if the \"innie\" memory is stored somehow directly on the chip, as some sort of USB drive. \n\nIf it's the former and not the later, I could see how the chip could help someone who suffers from a damaged hemisphere/part of a brain regain lost abilities. It would \"assign\" tasks from a damaged part of the brain to another part of it. But then again, is this how the brain REALLY works? \n\nModern medicine still does not know a lot about the human brain. When they severed Helly in the first episode, she knew the USA states. The way human brain works makes it that everything you know or learn is connected to something else \"a smell, a memory, a certain image\". So yeah, it's pretty inconsistent that her innie knows about USA states (which she probably learned by looking on the map in school, or heard their names from her parents when she was a kid etc) but does not know any other things about the world outside work. \n\nBrain just isn't an HDD like structure where memory &amp; knowledge are stored separately in some kind of contigous, well organized blocks.",

Honestly, I don\u2019t think the series is about AI in robot form, but more about bionic beings. Gemma seems to be one of them. Helena\u2019s dad as well. Maybe Natalie is. But either way, I\u2019d say it\u2019s Lumon taking the human brain and body and putting technology inside of it to control it. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re in the business of making robots. \n\nThat sort of thing would take considerable money to research and produce, and from what I\u2019ve seen their objective it controlling humans through technology - and creating a \u2018new species\u2019 that way.

Everything about it was perfect.  I loved the little touches, like the way Helly softly says \"okay!\" when Milchick starts dancing towards her.  Also loved that they all looked happy (well except for Dylan of course)... it reinforced how childlike the innies are. \n\nSecondly - Burt's retirement.  What an emotional gut-punch.  It made me realize that in real life, a person retiring from our workplace is sort of like a death in a way.  We see a person every day, they become familiar and comforting parts of our daily routine... and then they're gone.  Often a person retires and we never see them again.  Then one day we hear news that they died.  It's quite sad actually.\n\nAnyway fantastic show and episode.",
