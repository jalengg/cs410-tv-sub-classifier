And somehow ms Casey knows about Irv and Burts relationship, when Milchek was specifically trying to keep them apart and foster mistrust (the two versions of the paintings). So did Cobel tell Casey about Burt and Irvs relationship? Is she working against Milchek secretly? Casey seems to be in the know a little bit more than other people but not completely - she was concerned for mark and hellys safety wandering the halls. So many questions. There will be another season, the suspense is too much and I need answers now.",

Is it an experiment?\n* Burt was experiencing a similar event to Irving while in the conference room\n\n**What I think:**\n\n* The woman at the maternity facility is either:\n   * An Eagan\n   * The woman from the news who got pregnant while severed.\n* The excitement related to reintegration has something to do with bringing Kier back to life",

If they try to describe it to Irv and Dylan, those two will probably make fun of such a ridiculous idea.

I feel like her innie is going wage war on her outie, and vice versa. The outie must have some reason for sending her back in every time despite the horrifying conditions that would have caused her to go to such drastic measures. She *must* know what's going on not to question it.\n\nThe biggest new mystery of this episode were the goats. \"They're not ready yet. It isn't time.\" Are they breeding/cloning them to maturity? For what conceivable purpose? Others have pointed out that baby goats are called kids, which coincidentally lines up with Devon giving birth this episode (which we never actually see). All of these things give me shades of \"Lost\" and I can't help but wonder if some of them are red herrings meant to throw us off the path.\n\nCobel refers to \"running a 266\" on Irving. Is that what the swapped paintings were, to foster distrust between different departments? I found it interesting that Ms. Casey told Irving that Burt was in the conference room after that. Is she working for or against them? Also, Mark made passing reference to Helly looking at \"happy numbers\" for awhile, and I thought that was interesting that they could designate one or the other.\n\nThere's so much going on in this show that I feel like I need to watch it again just to catch everything. But it seems clear that almost everyone here has a secret agenda that they're keeping from others, and the innies are becoming suspicious and starting to question their purpose. I feel like they will most likely band together to expose the corruption of Lumon and regain control of their outies.",

I wanted to lay out some the themes:\n\n* Corporate Imperialism: all their stuff is Lumon brand, they're shoving office culture down our throats; they have corporate housing. Also the sort of idealization of Egan family is very walmarty you know? This has something to do with late stage capitalism for sure.\n* Biblical allusions: Helly; goats; biblical feeling paintings; godliness of kier egan (irving told someone to say \"egan\" instead of \"jesus\"). I think this speaks to some kind of apocalyptic vibes. Like the end is nigh.\n* Consciousness: Lots of references to the \"mind\" - on the map; in ricken's book. Could be the whole company is a \"mind\"; they are definitely dealing with some subconscious stuff. \n* Intergenerational legacy: well we have the egans, the pregnancies, the doula, etc. \n* Slavery: I mean this one is obvious.\n\nThings that come up a lot as theories that I'm not convinced are overall themes:\n\n* Resources / Resource extractions: people were sort of obsessed with water at the beginning in this sub, due to the water droplet logo and said the filenames are named after bodies of water. But they are also named after american cities, so I think this was a bit of a stretch. I dunno I think water may still have some component, but not a core theme necessarily.\n* Children: people think children are being severed or that's why the goats were in there, and we've got the pregnant sister and there's a reference to a severed employee who was pregnant. But I don't think this is an overall theme actually mainly because there literally isn't a child in the show yet as a character. I think this has more to do with family legacy than the vulnerability of children.",

Secondly the O&amp;D \u201cjokes\u201d about larvas in a pouch taking over MDRs bodies.\n\nThe severed are not second versions of the outies with different biographical memories, they are brand new conscious AIs that are \u201cinitialised\u201d with the personalities, non-autobiographical memories and skills of real people but their own new memory compartment.\n\nThe numbers? They\u2019re auditing their own code, that\u2019s why they feel something, it\u2019s literally their own mind. They are removing the humours deemed harmful by Kier.\n\nWhen they go down the elevator, they don\u2019t just switch memories, the AI just straight up takes over.\n\nAnd reintegration is just actual integration of the AI into the human, that\u2019s why it\u2019s such a big deal.\n\nThe departments also make sense then: what are important milestones for AI to achieve that we haven\u2019t yet? Improving itself (MDR), being creative (O&amp;D), potentially caring for humans (the goats)...",

      "body": "I thought it was an interesting callback to the painting that Burt and irv initially bond over outside the wellness center. One of the figures was a goat. At the time I thought it an anthropomorphic idea of \"dread\" and assumed that each of the figures represented one of the four tempers. I also feel like that is the cave that kier says he went to in his mind and conquered. So he conquers his four tempers, but one of them is more animal than rational/more instinct and intuitive than logical is my thinking here. It gives credence to the idea that Mark and Petey have been running around together based on just \"gut instinct\" since there is no rational reason for them to suspect lumon is more sinister than first revealed. I like the idea of the goat being dread because I think that is what Helly is out of the department. She is the emotional, the animal so to speak. She hears what sounds like a baby in the break room and then we hear the weird baby like cries of the goat leading her to the room. I like the idea of this being \"lambs led to slaughter.\" it would be cool to see if helly and mark are punished for being led to the room and their memories are \"slaughtered\" of it? I do also like how this all ties into more animal characteristics tied to other characters this episode. With O and D saying that MDR has larvae that eat themselves to remain young it calls to mind Irvs comment \"Hi kids, what's for dinner.\" Double entendre here since if they were once larvae the dinner would be themselves, or if he is references the goats he could be talking to the department as sacrificial themselves. Like if they are all the kids who \"aren't ready yet\" because they haven't completely finished refining themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit- Dylan is the one who hears the crying baby, Helly hears the man. Maybe between the two of them they hear the whole goat department?",

We still don\u2019t know what consciousness is, much less whether it has to be biological. \n\nAs a thought experiment, say that you had a computer powerful enough to perfectly simulate someone\u2019s brain. It would simulate every neuron and action potential and every input (sensations, chemicals from the rest of the \u201cbody,\u201d etc.) such that the simulated brain is, from its perspective, living as a real human. Would you consider that brain to be conscious, even though it\u2019s a machine? How do you know you\u2019re not a brain in a vat?\n\nIronically, I think the second half of the quote is a lot deeper than the first. Maybe the only difference between man and a sufficiently-advanced machine is the fact that we\u2019re made of flesh and they aren\u2019t. Of course, the whole quote is presented as humor in the show, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t also be the subject of analysis.\n\nOn the topic of man vs. machine, I suspect there will be some element of androids or AI at some point. Maybe even the Severance chip is running an AI that interfaces with the host\u2019s brain. That would also explain the proximity limits as the chip would need to be a certain distance away from the main computer. Also it explains why they referred to the removed chip as \u201cThat\u2019s Petey.\u201d Finally, it would explain why Outie Helly told Innie Helly that she\u2019s not a real person; maybe she literally isn\u2019t.",

While the racial disparity in treatment by medical professionals is well documented and can\u2019t be overstated, there are also other factors to consider, such as the higher rates of hypertension and obesity among African American women, which could also contribute to higher maternal mortality rates.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find good data on whether planned hospital births are safer than planned at-home births. There appear to be some positives for either scenario; however, at-home births are associated with double the risk of perinatal death and a threefold increase in risk of serious neurological dysfunction, see [here](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/04/planned-home-birth).\n\nAgain, I spent about 15 minutes doing a quick research on this, but I couldn\u2019t find anything to conclusively show that black women have better outcomes at home compared to a hospital birth. Each individual should educate themselves and make an informed decision on where and how to give birth, but you should be cautious that you aren\u2019t stating your own opinions as facts.\n\n(Edit: Also, please don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but the maternal mortality rate among black women in the US, although higher than that of white women, is 0.04%. While ideally that number would be 0%, your odds of dying during pregnancy as a black woman are lower than your odds of dying from the flu.\n\nAlso, most of the disparity is caused by cardiomyopathy and other blood pressure disorders, see [here](https://www.prb.org/resources/black-women-over-three-times-more-likely-to-die-in-pregnancy-postpartum-than-white-women-new-research-finds/). While systemic racism is undeniably the primary or sole factor that causes the racial disparity in blood pressure and obesity, it\u2019s hard to attribute this specific difference in maternal mortality to racist healthcare providers.)",

We are over here making fun of it and laughing at how childish it sounds. But hes selling copies man! which means...Society is F'd. HAHA If people in the world of Severence are so mind blocked, stumped, STUNTED, that they cant think for themselves, and here is this book that is TEACHING them how to think... and they are loving it!?!? Outside society in Severence is SCREWED. Remember the dinnerless dinner party? and how all the guests were kind of  total morons and idiots? It really made me think about what SOCIETY is really like for it to be a world where Rickens shitty book is making millions. KIND OF makes me wonder, WHO is getting severed? Is it all the SMART  PEOPLE? Like the smart folks are just checkin OUT because society is so screwed.  I mean, look at Mark, hes a PHD. I theorize Helly is a PHD as well.  Im actually willing to bet all 4 MDR are PHDS.  anway, theres my Ricken Book Rant      I LOVE YOU GUYS!",

Mark S., Helly R. etc. Some employees seem to be called by their first name and last initial and others Mr. &amp; Ms. Isn't last initial usually used to identify multiple people with the same name? My thoughts are that there are multiple versions of them and they are either Mark A, Mark B etc. Or there was a previous Mark and now Mark S. is the next iteration. What's happening to Irv with the black goo is he's being taken over and the next version of himself is going to come out soon.",

I feel like one is a die hard company loyalist and the other is working against the company, which I\u2019d guess is Harmony because of her issues with the Board? \n\nFor some reason when they showed the rich pregnant lady I immediately thought she was connected to Dylan somehow, because of his break room crying baby reference. \n\nSo glad to see more of Ms Casey, she seems different though outside of her office/therapy room place. She seemed kind of afraid and unsure of herself. \n\nLoved the scene with Irv and Burt, I could honestly watch the two of them interact all day it\u2019s so heartwarming. \n\nLastly, is Harmony watching them all the time like that? If so have they noticed Mark with the book or him showing Helly the map? They really are all over the place, and I\u2019d be surprised if they wouldn\u2019t be watching them constantly",

An interesting fact about the Devil Tarot trump is that it features two \u201cpeople\u201d who are chained to a stone on which the devil sits. However, if you look closely, the chains are loosely placed around their necks, and they could remove them at any time\u2014their bondage is only illusory, the result of the inversion of their perception.

Well, when Mark takes her to the stair case he stays around the corner and tells her he can't watch her leave and I've been trying to figure out why he couldn't watch. I wonder if because the severance comes from an optical connection and by seeing outside of the door he would have flipped back to his outie while still on the severed floor. That would explain why Helly was in outie form when they pulled her down from the rafters. She was still conscious when she left the severed floor and transitioned to her outie but she had lost conscious when she went back down so the flip to innie never happened. And maybe this has something to do with how the reintegration process works??",

It would explain how the rich pregnant cabin lady had \u201ca lot of help\u201d with her kids and why she and that man there (who ran away) were acting so strange. And when Dylan said most files expire before they\u2019re finished - are some babies dying?\n\nLess plausible, but maybe the lambs were actually human babies (the chips altered Helly and Mark\u2019s perceptions). It would sort of explain why the man with the lambs/babies was so stressed to give them up.\n\nI also think the midwife is sus!",

He probably knows too much even if he doesn\u2019t realize it, hence the black goo visions and inter-departmental relations. Gah, this show does my brain in but I love it! I have questions and theories after every episode but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being thrown around with the plot. Nothing is inexplicable on its face, it\u2019s just the motives of the company and those who work there. For the first time in a long time I have found a show that leaves me happily puzzled.",

That\u2019s only eight or nine hours each day you need to spend consciously existing \u2014 and we already know that Mark spends that time getting absolutely blotto drunk. He doesn\u2019t want to exist at all, and this is the closest he can get.\n\nI think the only reason he\u2019s kept himself alive at all is because of his sister \u2014 we know that they\u2019re close, and that they\u2019re the only family they have left. (I also think that\u2019s why she tried so hard to make sure he\u2019s included in things like the dinner party and her birth, and pushes him to go on that date.

Going along with the AI development theory of Lumon (AI chip implanted in human body for half of its waking life)---Ms Casey had been given more freedom/allowed more \"noise\" in her programming which is why she tells Irving about Burt in the conference room (she wouldn't approve of interdepartmental engagement if she was acting in alignment with Lumon procedural protocols).

It may be that Cobel instructed him to leave the book in the conference room or he may have actually accidentally left it there when the code alarm went off. I think it\u2019s unlikely that he would read the book in the conference room in full view of anyone who could be passing by and even less likely that he would just drop it on a chair and then leave it there, given what a major contraband any book would be. It is far more likely that he was told to read it openly and then leave it behind. At no pint has he been called out for allowing the book to be found, so obviously Coble is ok with it being out there and circulating. Then of course it was spotted by Irv and the crew and from there began to circulate. All of this is exactly the strategy used by The Party with regards to Emmanuel Goldstein\u2019s book in 1984.",

The problem with most broadcast TV series is that the writers drag the \"mysteries\" out and invent new, shoddy ones just to keep the series going.  And since the networks usually decide when a series is canceled, the shows tend to end too hastily or sloppily.\n\nI prefer self-contained series that have well thought out plot structures - including proper endings.  There are couple of possible outcomes that could really sour my opinion of the show:\n\n* They don't address the mysteries of this season: They leave the audience hanging for \"answers\" that never come.  The writers just continually invent poorly thought out plots with no planned ending in sight.  An ending eventually arrives, but it's literally just thrown together at the last moment.\n* They do address the mysteries of the season: But then go on to invent new, sub-par mysteries for the following seasons.  Once the mystery of this season is gone, it's difficult to see how they're going to maintain audience interest for subsequent seasons.\n\nThey can't simply tell another story within the MDR department.  Once we know what goes on there, the magic of this season will be gone.  The best way forward for a following season would be to create another self-contained story with new characters, within this universe, but not in the MDR department.",

I found it far-fetched that saying a phrase over and over would break a person as strong as Helly seems to be, but maybe during the process those background sounds allow the innnie to access the feelings associated with their traumatic memories, if not the memories themselves.

That is, severance is not air-tight as Lumen may have presumed. During the retreat scene, Ricken talks about his disappointment that Mark did not call back about his book, that it was an advanced copy, etc. All those sentences laying out the groundwork for Mark to talk and subconsciously say something about the book, giving a hint to Ricken that innie-Mark had read the book. That did not happen, I found it to be a let-down and wondered what was the point of this idle, useless chit-chat between Ricken and Mark. Character development? Sure, maybe, but what about priorities? The episode was 45 min instead of the expected hour long, and there is SO MUCH to answer. At this point, mid-season, each additional mystery they pile up onto the already huge heap of questions to be answered increases the risk of being disappointed by the end of this show.\n\nCrossing fingers for Ep 6 to get back on track and meet the same quality standards of 1-4.",

When you look at the security footage of Helly in the elevator, the empty security chair seems ominous. Even the paper cutter Helly used is still on the desk. The security guard really only has 2 times per day he HAS to be there (in theory), morning and evening. Seems really odd that he wouldn't be there at 5:15pm. If so, why would Milchick want Helly dead?",

It could be argued that Ricken\u2019s quote \u201ca good person will follow the rules, a great person will follow himself\u201d foreshadow this later in the episode.\n\nFor his outie, Mark has breached his silence of his experience with Petey by sharing the beginning of the story with his sister.

But I personally loved it. There isn\u2019t a single episode I didn\u2019t enjoy, and I\u2019ve been recommending it to lots of friends. Every episode is so tightly written! Totally deserves to be mentioned amongst the pantheon of the other great American comedies (P&amp;R, AD, The Office, etc).\n\nIt reminds me of British comedy a lot, honestly. There\u2019s an underlying misery (and the series is very short) haha. Looking forward to season 3!",

It's a merger of two personas into one. Not a reintegration, but forced integration.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Another piece of evidence is that I recall Harmony and co. referring to the extracted chip itself as Petey.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The simplest test to this theory would be removing the chip from a living severed employee's brain. If only the outie stays in the body after that, then the innie has to be stored in the chip.!&lt;\n\nThis might actually be obvious to some people already, but I wanted to record it to see how it holds up when I've seen more episodes.",
