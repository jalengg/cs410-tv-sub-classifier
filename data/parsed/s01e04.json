Was worried the general feel of this one might be different as its the first with the different director but it was just as good - maybe better!\n\nAlso recurring theme - the first 20 or so mins of each ep are at a slow pace but the tension ramps up along with the pacing beautifully in the last 40 mins of each show and I never want it to end - I'm addicted to the formula\n\n\\*spoilers ahead\\* \n\nGreat to see more of Walken in this one - his scenes with Irving were compelling. and the reveal at the end that its \\*a bit\\* more than just a 2 person department shocked me. Not sure what this will mean. Perhaps Dylan was right about O&amp;D being bad vibes\n\nHelley - wow. incredibly dramatic even though we knew what she was gonna do. 99% sure we will see her again but my mind is already racing with ways she will survive. You would think she would have been watched closer given her actions. Also that reminds me we know the department is crawling with cameras and monitoring devices but they were openly discussing \"contraband\" maps and books all day without Graner/Milchik stepping in?? Not to mention they are seemingly completely free to roam about the corridors as they see fit which surprised me\n\nSelvig/Cobel continues to creep me out. She is on the cusp of proving reintegration with Peteys chip and the fact Mark made a tree out of clay (presumably representing the tree where his wife died in a car accident). If she can prove it to the board this surely puts Mark's safety at risk\n\nAlso just had a thought. The break room must be almost as mentally exhausting for Milchik as it is for the victims lol. Kinda wish Helley had just outright refused to give the apology. Presumably they would have done something even worse then but would be funny to see her and Milchik just sat in the break room for the rest of the series",

If futurism is sometimes called a \"science\" bent on anticipating what will come, retrofuturism is the remembering of that anticipation. Characterized by a blend of old-fashioned \"retro styles\" with futuristic technology, retrofuturism explores the themes of tension between past and future, and between the alienating and empowering effects of technology.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

The whole time they are in the severed area of Lumon, it\u2019s like another world. Love every second of it. \n\nIrv is my fav by far, it\u2019s basically told to us that he\u2019s been severed and at his position the longest. It totally makes sense that, since their reality as innies is confined solely to the basement of Lumon, that his religious attachment to the handbook and lore of the company would be something that might develop over time. It\u2019s all that version of him knows, and I find his whole philosophy so interesting. It\u2019s the dude from work that \u201cdrank the kool aid\u201d but to the nth degree. \n\nThe show also really investigates super interesting topics with their separated memories. Hellys innie vs outtie conflict is so fascinating, this power struggle between two versions of the same person. The outtie claiming that she is in control, that she calls the shots really makes the ending of this episode hit home, with her innie defiantly spitting in the face of that claim. I really don\u2019t see her being dead, more like a chess move and attempt to retake control. \n\nCannot wait for more of this show.",

But even from her own self-interested perspective, she is playing a very dangerous game.  The gauntlet she just threw down essentially invites her innie to go not just for bodily mutilation but total suicide.  Something they can't fix in time even by immediately calling 911--like stabbing herself in the carotid artery, maybe.  Her outtie told her she has no hope, and did it in such a shitty way as to invite no sympathy from her \"non-person\" innie.\n--------\n\nA serious miscalculation, seems to me.",

It's a strange philosophy that the workers are non-persons.\n\nAccording to the Protestant work ethic, which seems to inform a lot of what we see as the philosophy of the company's founder, it's work that gives life meaning--so it's more like the outtie would be the non-person if anyone is.\n\nAnd how are the executives of the company supposed to feel about a statement like that?  It comes across as very dismissive of the importance and value of what they do there, whatever it is.  Certainly her message does not square well with the wellness and restoration office or whatever it's called.\n\nThe bit of Mark's brother-in-law's book we saw made me think of the Herman Melville short story \"Bartleby the Scrivener\".",

This episode really made me think about the cult like mindset that\u2019s still needed to maintain control at Lumen and the lengths Lumen goes to just to keep things in check. It\u2019s not enough to just sever peoples brains. You need to put them in a cult like environment, you need to punish (aka psychologically torture/break) them for rule breaking, and you need to provide them with the occasional will to live via wellness checks that remind them of why their \u201coutie\u201d is important. \n\nHelly could just be a way to show us what a new hire goes through, she just happens to be a particularly chaotic new hire that Lumen wasn\u2019t at all prepared for\u2014 and if that\u2019s the case, her dying this early actually makes sense.",

Thus having distracting cravings for a co-worker seems inevitable. Also it would lead to wandering behavior which we may have seen in this episode (not sure if they're 'going there' with two veteran actors). Moreover, if you wanted to get out of there wouldn't anti-social behavior like constantly hitting or hitting on your co-workers be a lot more productive than hanging yourself? So there should be a way to tamp down people's emotions &amp; libido besides the weirdo founder philosophy.\n\nDo they put Saltpeter in the vending machine snacks?

I think it's safe to say she will be discovered before any permanent damage occurs, but that would be a huge wrench in the works to off her in the middle of the season. I feel like she is too important a character to die, though.\n\nI just started watching this show a few days ago, but it's already so fascinating to me. The way that each character tries to \"keep in line\" in their own way, yet are each subverting the rules privately. Mark's outie obviously knows Petey's secret, while Mrs. Selvig/Harmony is keeping her identity a secret from him. Mark's innie is shook by Helly's rebellious nature and the discovery of the map and book, and I loved that shot of Mark internally debating what to do with the angel (Irving) and devil (Dylan) over each shoulder. Dylan seems to have no allegiances towards anyone (including the company), while Irving is completely by the book and a stickler for the rules. That is, until tempted by his \"forbidden\" workplace romance with Burt. And Helly herself is an enigma because her innie seems to be the polar opposite of her stringent outer self. How did she manage to wind up working at Lumon Industries and is her outie an important character to the company? (Perhaps she was *forced* to record that video back to her inner self?)\n\nAs always with these weekly released shows, the wait between episodes is torture. But I have no idea where the rest of this season is going, so that's a fun spot to be in.",

It's possible that just as innies have the break room for workday contrition, outties are expected to show loyalty and dedication to the program when asked. Perhaps outtie Helly is now aware that her role in the organization, or comfort/safety, is predicated on the compliance of her innie.\n\nOne thing we know is that innies never have their resignations approved. But the story on the outside is that innies can leave whenever they want. Maybe Lumen has to create reasons to compel the outties to \"choose\" to stay, whether it's incentives, threats, or loyalty.",

She threatens innie Helly in the video that if innie Helly tries to harm herself (as way of getting out), that she will keep innie Helly in there forever.\n\nInnie Helly can simply refuse to work - if she has 0% productivity, or chooses to nap all day, is Lumon going to pay outie Helly?  (Milchick told Irv that his nap time would be deducted from his outie's pay, so lack of performance has to have some effect on compensation.)  In most companies, insubordination is grounds for dismissal.  And so what if they try to use the break room on her?  It doesn't matter!  She can waste Milchick's time by just reading the statement over and over without any emotion, until she breaks him.  We know Helly is strong-willed, and I wouldn't put it past her.\n\nIn this world, there are really no consequences for bad behavior, because unlike in the real world where employees try to avoid getting fired, innie Helly \\*wants\\* to leave this job by any means possible, even though it means the end of her own existence.",

In that, they\u2019re attracted to each other and are bonding. That\u2019s why I see the intimacy as romantic rather than erotic, and there hasn\u2019t been any body language or anything else indicating any sexual element, just their shared interests and Irving\u2019s fascination and admiration for Burt and his work.\n\nAnd you\u2019re right about what they know of conventional social cues, as the only ones they know are the ones prescribed by their work environment, which are extremely limited. To them, this level of intimacy between coworkers is probably considered taboo, which likely adds to the thrill of discovery/being discovered\u2014 hence my \u201cin a 1984 sort of way\u201d comment earlier. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve read that book or seen the film, but there\u2019s a forbidden romance in that story that begins not unlike this one.\n\nIn any case, these two are the innocents you describe, and they\u2019re navigating these new feelings the best they can: slowly, fearful, surreptitiously, and carefully. Who knows where it will go? With these two veteran actors, I can\u2019t wait to see how they navigate this extraordinarily complex interaction.",

I know it's what leads to Helly's storyline but that first meeting being so important i feel like the 'screw up' should have happened in a more convincing manner. \nBut maybe they didn't anticipate it to go that wrong after, and Helly just turned out to be an extreme case.\n\nCould also just be remembering the ep1 scenes wrong and gotta rewatch \ud83d\ude05\n\nEither way, loving the show.

Why would Milchick even bring the book there, of all places? The prior episode shows him studying it in the restricted reception room outside Harmony's office.\n\nParts were read separately by Mark and Dylan - the two cynical yet moderate team members - **over several hours** in their perceived workspace privacy. The other two were more proactive in pushing beyond their workspace boundaries within the expectations of their  personalities. Yet middle management was ***visibly absent and unconcerned*** in any of their whereabouts or behavior.\n\nB&amp;E do/did share an outie relationship much less tolerated within their age group, leading to Irving's severance years ago due to personal and social pressures. Burt, like Harmony, began/remains a fully cognizant Lumen research worker, in part as a private mutual agreement to continually monitor both Irving's *innie and outie stability*. They likely assisted in Petey's reintegration to ascertain the risks before attempting it on Irving; regretting Irving's *earlier* life choices as attitudes and awareness of the diversity of sexual orientations became more civil.",

Also, it's an obvious fit with the idea of getting severed.\n\nCan't be the full story (the outside world must be real, otherwise how does Ricken's book get into the office)- but perhaps part of it?\n\nAlso, from what Petey's daughter says to Mark at the funeral, seems like all severed workers have some sort of trauma/mental issues. Backed up by the map- 'we're here because we're not all there'.",

So if she leaves or cuts off her fingers it would be dismal for Lumon.  But they didn\u2019t count on the fact that her outtie is not broken or suffering.

They just tell you to do smthng 3 times and people seem to comply. So what if you dont? What they gonna do? Pull out your fingernails? Gandhi comes to mind. \"I refuse to submit. You can hit me and beat me and kill me. Then, you will have my broken body. NOT my submission.\" When Lumon meets an inmovable object, someone deadset on leaving like Helly, they have no other choice but to let her go. Bc the other alternative is resort to violence until death. At which point theyll have a dissapearance to manage, and still not gotten the submission.\n\nResisting submission until death is always an option for those with that suicidal will. And Helly has it. I'm amazed she didn't just resort to filling the rest of her career at Lumon with 8h/day break room. (Thus also making sure Milchick is taken up 8/day torturing someone. Thus taking 2 employees' produ tivity  down to zero fulltime. And giving the others respite from supervision). It would be in the best interest of Lumon to simply allow her to quit. Less hassle. Theyll either need to find a new Milchick, who's morally bankrupt and competent, or get a newbie to torture Helly all day. Who would probably also revolt at having to do that as a job. Also, once Helly clogs up the breakroom, no one else can use it. Or do they have several? Helly deciding to double down on refusing submission and accepting dictation-torture would ruin Lumon. \n\nI feel like the average ukranian or someone from a hard part of the world would be enough to break the entire severance wing of Lumon. Takes just 1 stubborn bastard to bring it all grinding to a halt. Or at least to such low productivity levels that the cost of letting them go is infinitely more preferable.",

Does this mean that we are watching a memory of mark grieving for her?\n\nEven deeper dive, is our ability to view the memory and then see the wellness treatment mean maybe they are refining/deleting the memory from his outie so that his innie can construct the tree with the candle? The end of the wellness scene made it seem like that memory was being literally molded into a new innie memory where the tree has nothing to do with a car crash and he is losing his memory of his wife dying in that manner forever?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) a smaller detail but nothing in this show seems left to chance- when mark arrrives for work in previous episodes the parking lot is full of cars, thus he has to park far away towards the edge of the parking lot. But even though the innies seem to get out of work after a regular eight hour shift, there are no cars in the parking lot when Mark leaves, other than Helly's. Which makes no sense if they are staggered in and out off the office so that they don't accidentally run into each other. Plus, where are all the other people who should be leaving the huge complex around the same time of five pm? Why are all their cars gone? Are they losing more than eight hours as innies? is that why the analog clocks only in the severed floor? Do they think they are clocking in for an eight hour shift but having more time stolen from them? otherwise why would they show scenes of an empty parking lot at a normal \"clock out\" time for a huge company?",

She doesn't _ask_ him to turn it off, she _tells_ him to turn it off. There's an air of authority when she says it -- like she's used to giving orders to everyone around her. \n\nBased on her condescending, even cruel demeanor, in her video reply to her Innie, I suspect that Outtie Helly holds some high level corporate position -- either at Lumon, but more likely at another company that's considering adopting the severance procedure. Outtie Helly is just giving Innie Helly a trial run -- unbeknownst to Innie Helly, her position at Lumon as a member of the Data Refinement Team was never intended to be permanent.  \n\nThis is why Innie Helly is doing everything she can to get out of her situation. As someone in a position of power, Outtie Helly would never actually choose to subject herself permanently to the life of a severed worker. It was supposed to be just a test -- maybe she volunteered for no reason other than simple curiosity. Which would make her suicide, if Innie Helly is successful, all that more tragic.  \n\nOuttie Helly appears to have a superiority complex and she's probably used to being obeyed without question. The idea that a subordinate like Innie Helly would have the audacity to rebel and go against her wishes infuriates Outtie Helly to no end. Even if that subordinate is a version of her severed self. \n\nInnie Helly hanging herself in the elevator would be a big FU to Outtie Helly. I hope she survives just so we get to see Outtie Helly's reaction to being out-maneuvered by someone she normally looks down on and treats with contempt. Haughty Outtie Helly might be due for a rude awakening. \n\nThis show is so wonderfully f'ed up, Lol \ud83d\ude02",

I only talk about eps 1-4 so all readers here should be caught up.\n\nI'm trying to find a discussion on red. Yes, the color. Red is the color of the outside world. Mark's outtie wears a red shirt. Mark has a bright red fish that swims sadly behind him while he watches TV and gets drunk. He also drinks a lot of wine at home. Is it red?? I have to look at that again. Pete's robe at Mark's house is red. Ricken's book is reddish/orange. When Mark goes to the funeral, there's red everywhere: roses, curtains, etc. Even Mrs. Selvig wears clothes with patches of red in the outtie world &amp; at the funeral. Mark goes to the bar and orders whiskey. But what libations are available at the funeral bar? Just wine. Mark orders red. And here's the last thing. What color is Helly's hair? Red. Do we know what Helly stands for yet? I don't want to go down this rabbit hole too far in case it's not, but is it Helena? There are lots of stories about Helena throughout history. Here is one: \"St. Helena, Discoverer of the True Cross.\" Also, the show is very, very biblical &amp; cultish (same/same). There is only one book in the innie world. In fact, the author of the book commands readers to not read lesser books. Oh boy, has that been a topic of conversation in recent years at, say, school board and library meetings.\n\nAs for who Helly-- with the bright red hair --is, when she comes in for her Severance procedure, Millchick is fawning over her, which I guess is a polite way to treat any new member to a cult. But he also says it's a \"miracle\" that she's there to be part of the program (in fairness, it's another thing you say when someone joins your cul...er...religion). Past ep. 4, there's still a lot yet to be revealed, but keep an eye on red. It's almost as significant in Severance as it was in that ancient flick, The Sixth Sense.",

If I'm not in the right place, I apologize. \n\nBy episode 3, I was convinced Helly volunteered as a spy. In ep 4 when she berates and puts her innie in her place on that \"I resign again!\" video, it's a kind of way of scolding her innie for not going through with the plan. And it's not like her outtie could've coddled her innie to be more complacent and go through with the plan because she went undercover. And outtied Helly probably knew she was sacrificing what would become innie Helly and came to terms with that self punishment. (Of course, there's still a lot to learn about those videos when/how they were made/originated. The characters are reading pre-written remarks.) BUT, after watching ep. 4, i'm wondering if Helly was actually more important in the world-- perhaps a celebrity. But not like a movie star because people would be wondering what Helly would be doing taking a 9-5 at a controversial, non-entertainment company like Lumen. But a big shot in a particular world. Politics? Eh, not sure. Mark may have recognized her that first day in the parking lot. Corporate higher-up? Maybe a Lumen owner (not part of the Egan family)? You can tell she's commanding and in charge. It is possible she's part of the Egan family (different last name) went astray at some point and it's a miracle she decided to be the prodigal daughter and do the whole thing from the ground up.   \nI should have looked at other threads for Helly's origin--and still can, I guess. If you know of any, i'm happy to redirect these thoughts.",

Ricken's red book also gets introduced to the blue innie world, so I feel like Ricken represents the outside world spilling into the inside world.\n\nOh, and there's also the red candle being introduced by Harmony. Guessing by her name, she might also have a role in reintegrating. (She also brought in Ricken's book).\nDefinitely will keep an eye out for characters and symbols with red now.\nAlso, Mark wears a red jumpsuit in the intro sequence.\n\nSide note: I wonder if the reintegraters will be represented by purple.

Even if she was only gone five minutes, this seems unlikely.\n\nYes, it was done for effect. According to the clock it was about an hour and a half. It's reasonable to assume that Milchick immediately went upstairs to handle outie Helly, and we know that outie Helly spoke with Cobel before making her recording. So they weren't all just standing there in the basement the whole time. They reassembled in front of the elevator to see Helly come back down (although it's a stretch to have us believe that they would all be standing in the exact same positions as earlier). Like I said, it was done for effect, to show how innie Helly must feel to think she's escaping, only to end up right back in the same situation a moment later.\n\n&gt; Mark still has a backup copy of the map at the abandoned greenhouse.\n\nPetey was also working on another copy in Mark's basement when Cobel broke in. I don't know if they showed what happened to it (if it's still somewhere in the basement or if Petey took it with him when he walked to the gas station). Anyway the show seems to be indicating to us (by having innie Mark destroy the original map) that the actual details of the map are not what's important. Its purpose was to make the MDR employees curious about what might be going on elsewhere in the basement (are there people living in houses, etc.)\n\n&gt; The implication of the first edition passage that Burt quoted is that the current handbook has been changed and likely perverted for ulterior motives over time (by subsequent CEOs?)\n\nI don't think necessarily \"perverted\" since it's normal that the handbook would have to be updated periodically for modern tech: computers and group photos and coffee machines and elevators and code detectors, and severance itself. You can't expect Kier to have addressed all of that in the first edition. But I don't understand why they would have removed that Kier quotation about whispering through future generations.",

Irving chose severance because his personality clearly displays a sense of self worth based on external ideals of both work and personal lifestyles - think of his reactions to the company therapist's list of his outtie's behavior or his reverence of its CEO's. Burt became a research worker to keep a quiet eye on Irving's in/outside mental stability, allowing him a more cohesive autonomy akin to Harmony.\n\nBurt plays some role in reintegration development by testing its viability on Petey before trying it on his beloved. Their outside selves no longer see a need for Irving to remain closeted in any aspect of his life. But with Irving's 'discoveries', his innie will adopt a reserved version of Dylan's; focusing feelings of distrust or betrayal on O&amp;D while remaining loyal to Lumon as a whole. They represent the type of workers who must believe their personal work ethics aren't in conflict with their employer's overall function, policies and procedures.\n\nTo what extent this form of reintegration was ever sanctioned by the board will likely be revealed in the next 1-2 episodes, with the remaining being attempts of its use on MDR 'workers' closing up the series.",

The way its subjects are purposely being kept in the dark, being fed propaganda, the leaders words being treated as religious gospel, which substitute for actual religion, the way everyone slaves and toils away for meager rewards (waffle party being the utmost prize), deluding themselves their work is noble and will bring prestige to the company.\n\nAnd now that book by Mark's brother in-law accidentally surfaced into this immaculate, seemingly impenetrable environment, which will challenge the dogma, the same way people from the communist eastern block were trying to tune to western radio frequencies and hear outside information that would present a completely different reality than what they were being fed by the regime.\n\nNow, communist metaphor aside, the actual work they do, looking at \"scary numbers\", seems like a crock of shit. My gut feeling is the work this company does is actually observing the employees themselves, they look like guinea pigs in a social experiment, to see how far you can indoctrinate someone in a closed system.\n\nCurious if many others share my feelings, hope i'm not way off the mark lol.",

This could be because readers enjoy reading expected endings, because knowing the ending allows them to appreciate aesthetic elements instead of guessing what will happen, or because knowing the ending increases fluency by enabling readers to correctly interpret clues and events. We conducted three experiments to test these hypotheses. Experiment 1 collected ratings at the midpoints of anthologized stories, and determined that readers experience greater pleasure even before reading the end of spoiled stories. This spoiler benefit was mediated by processing fluency, and not by appreciation of aesthetic elements. Experiment 2 found that spoilers similar to those in Experiment 1 do not increase ease of reading \u2014 or pleasure \u2014 for very-easy-to-read stories. Experiment 3 found, however, that very simple spoilers could increase the pleasure of easy-to-read stories.\n\nhttps://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ssol.3.1.09lea",

This episode really makes me think that they are patients being treated for severe depression, not employees at an office. They aren\u2019t allowed to leave (the area). There is a crafts room. They are restored by a therapist who is trying to teach them to regulate their emotions. We know that Mark lost his wife 3 years ago and arrived at Lumon 2 years ago. Petey went through a divorce which can also trigger massive depression. His daughter said \u201care you from Lumon\u201d (not \u201cdo you work there\u201d) and \u201cdid you ever think maybe you should deal with your problems in some other way than shutting off half your brain.\u201d \n\nI think Burt is Irv\u2019s husband visiting him but maintaining the role play. \n\nWhen Mark is looking at the birthing center online, he says it looks like a ski resort. The whole town is a hospital system, much like the place in Europe that built a replica town for Alzheimer\u2019s patients to live in safely. \n\nThat or they just trying to draw parallels between the workplace and mental hospitals.",

Except for the car bed.\n\nAlso, that whole thing about moving between beds being traumatic was freaking weird, something is up there. \n\nOn Hellys first day it was mentioned that they don't experience sleep, only its after effects.\n\nIrv chastises Mark for almost sitting on the bed in the perpetuity wing.\n\nWhen Petey is hiding in the basement, He sleeps on a couch not a bed.\n\nSomeone is shown in a bed in the picture Irv seeks out, but it is their deathbed.\n\nPretty sure something is up with beds.",
