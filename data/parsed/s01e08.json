Also Cobel was disappointed when it didn't work, in my opinion. If only Gemma's innie persona is awake, maybe Cobel is trying to see if someone who only has an innie persona left (Charlotte) can remember her/someone\n* Okay, so I'm not convinced that Gemma/Ms. Casey is a robot; I think she just acts so robotically because she has only existed for four whole days and that's how they told her she was supposed to be. If she's only awake in half hour bursts, that's not much time to build a sense of self and self expression. We can see her real emotions developing when she confesses to Mark that she enjoyed their day.\n* Since Ms. Casey lives on the \"Testing Floor\", we can assume that the \"car accident\" victims are taken by Lumon to be lab rats\u2014the only way they can kidnap people to be experimented on without a scandal is if those people are dead.\n* The Waffle Party??? Lumon-ordained lap dance...was he supposed to be Kier in the painting and whip the dancers? Also, where do they get the dancers and what do they think they're doing?\n* Our brief flash of outie Helly was 100% her at the Lumon gala. I am so so certain in my Helly is an Eagan [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/tiwr6e/my_comprehensive_powerpoint_on_why_helly_is_an/), deniers try and fight me now!!!

She's likely one of the early Lumon believers and raised Harmony in this cult, thus why Harmony's belief system in Lumon is so deep-rooted. \n- When they 'recruited' Gemma to the program, Harmony had a vested interest as she's hoping Gemma and Mark would recognize each other even when severed. Also why she moved next to him to closely monitor him and why she kept arranging for them to meet. \n- This would explain why she believes reintegration is possible coz she wants to reintegrate her Mom and reunite with her.\n- Unsure if they call her Mom up to the severed floor they way they do with Ms Casey tho...

It could be a big publicity thing for investors and/or the general public.\n\nI've also seen theories that she is merely married to an Eagan and is therefore attempting to help her husband. \n\nAnd of course, it could turn out she has nothing to do with any Eagans and is at that party for entirely different reasons.\n\nLots of possibilities here- all we can know for certain is that outie Helly is clearly a person in a high position that does not have any moral dilemma about creating her innie.",

They seem to mostly rely on this long story / extended movie style instead of episodic and my guess is it's to encourage binge watching and so people don't think they can just wait a few years and casually watch reruns on syndication. \n\nThe downside is there is a lot of filler and there will always be cliff hangers and new twists, it never ends until they want to end the show and if that ending is abrupt, it may never be resolved for the viewer. It also makes it harder to casually watch later on. You can't flip on a random episode since it will feel like you're starting in the middle of a movie, you have to start from the beginning.",

You know they're going to do something similar for the season finale next week that will have us pulling out our hair, too.\n\nI like that we get somewhat of an explanation for the black goo Irving's innie has been hallucinating. And it's incredibly sad that Ms. Casey is only activated for those brief therapy sessions. Does that mean Gemma is in a coma, or perhaps her outie has amnesia? And what does that mean for her \"retirement\" -- are they going to take her off life support or something?\n\nI had to laugh that the waffle party literally involved eating a single waffle, alone. The term \"waffle party\" always sounded vaguely sexual to me (kind of like blue waffle, maybe?), so I wasn't surprised there was some weird cult ritual attached to it. Same with \"innies\" and \"outies.\" My mind always goes there first.\n\nI don't really understand what was in that box that Milchick gifts Dylan (the hologram thingie?). What is the significance of that? And why was everyone so proud to see that '90s-era computer game completion screen when Helly reached 100%? Also, now that Ms. Casey and Cobel have been fired, and Graner was brutally murdered, does that mean there's only Milchick and Natalie working at the department now? Seems like they are severely understaffed there for such a huge project.\n\nSo next week will be the reveal of all the outies. As Irving puts it: \"Okay kids, let's find out what's for dinner.\" I have to scream at the fact that Mark's innie will come face to face with Harmony in the outside world, but maybe her loyalties will lie differently now that she's been sacked.",

In terms of geology, there is no importance given to how \u201cplain\u201d a rock looks.  Some of the ugliest rocks can be very interesting and or valuable.  For example, to an untrained eye, a kimberlite rock may look like a dull, dirty, ugly, worthless rock, yet it may contain diamonds.  And at the superficial level, any person with eyes can distinguish between a rock that looks plain and one that doesn\u2019t\u2014this is not in itself, taken literally, a superlative ability for a person to have.\n\nSo I suspect that there is something else to this \u201cfact\u201d about Mark S., since from the point of view of actual expertise about rocks, there is no actual meaning to the word \u201cplain\u201d as a descriptor, and I also don\u2019t think it should be taken at face value/superficial appearance (i.e. there is no importance to Mark S.

It depicts a man standing upon a rocky precipice with his back to the viewer; he is gazing out on a landscape covered in a thick sea of fog through which other ridges, trees, and mountains pierce, which stretches out into the distance indefinitely. It has been considered one of the masterpieces of the Romanticism movement and one of its most representative works. The painting has been widely interpreted as an emblem of self-reflection or contemplation of life's path, and the landscape is widely considered to evoke the sublime.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

I think it had something to do with proving something to her and the board about her mother, which might give her cause to be able to have her brought back or re-integrated or something.\n\nPete's chip proves that people can be re-integrated but also when talking about Pete's chip Cobel I think said, \"He's in there.\" or \"That's him.\" which almost sounds like the chip doesn't just belong to Pete but may actually somehow contain both Pete's innie and outtie, which made me wonder if you could put them into someone else, and not only would you have successfully transplanted a consciousness into a new body but you could integrate people or re-integrate them in someone else.",

Recall that mark sculpted the tree (that his wife crashed into) in his one wellness session.\n\n\nEmotions can \u201ccross the barrier\u201d between innie and outie\u2014we\u2019ve been explicitly told as much\u2014so when Irving paints based on feeling, the end result winds up being something like that. I don\u2019t think his outie actually knows what it is that he keeps painting.\n\n\n\nI think the fact that he puts on music and the fact that they film him painting in the way they do is meant to tell us that he\u2019s painting based on emotion. We see him allowing himself to get swept up in his feelings while he\u2019s painting. That\u2019s why he\u2019s able to replicate an image that he shouldn\u2019t really know about.\n\n\n(Note that my assumption as to the specifics of why he\u2019s painting that imagine in particular is that Burt was recently retired (remember Irving saying \u201cyou\u2019re just going to let them kill you?!\u201d). My assumption is that the innies have some type of knowledge of the \u201cretirement place\u201d. Thus, Irving paints his feelings and his subconscious mind goes to Burt\u2019s retirement in the same way that mark\u2019s mind goes to the tree)\n\n\n\nEDIT: Ummm\u2026 just had another thought: Smell is tied strongly to both emotion and memory (see, eg, cobel \u201ctesting\u201d mark with his wife\u2019s candle and that leading mark to sculpt the tree)\u2014it would make a LOT OF SENSE for the SMELL OF PAINT to remind Irving of Burt.",

      "body": "Apologies as I'm new here but I wanted to summarise a perspective on the whole Kier worship, board, purpose of the MDR work and Harmony. That's probably too much in one go, but hey count it as a newbie splurge!\n\n**Harmony/Ms Selvig** has been working her way to get access to the board for years for her own personal reasons. The shrine is private, personal and not known to the Lumon board, reflects a long term obsessive family connection that represents loss and hope. Prayer and worship represents longing for something that cannot be achieved through your own or other known actions, with a belief that a higher power can grant that longing. Whether this be a child or mother, the clues in the shrine suggest loss of a loved person that they believe could be restored.\n\nShe has actively sought to demonstrate reintegration or the failures of severance as a way of accessing the board and being able to speak directly to the higher power. That is why she has tried to demonstrate some connection between Ms Casey and iMark, and was so desperate to retrieve Petey's chip since that gave her access to the board. &gt;!It also explains the extreme immediate reaction to being fired and the destruction of the shrine since being fired means a loss of years of work towards being with the board and presenting the case for recovering the person she loved and lost.!&lt;\n\n**Purpose of severance and MDR:** Lumon expends huge resources on a very small number of people and the facilities to maintain the illusion of the innie world. This requires the work itself to realise a high value in itself, it's not enough to be research as research would require iterative change, not a repetitive task. Such high and sustained value for a service rather than manufactured goods would come through maintaining power over people, extending life/cognition, or financial gain. Financial gain is too boring for the show and difficult to sustain long term. The Senators wife being severed suggests use of severance as a means of control, whereas there are multiple references to extended life or consciousness such as the perpetuity wing.\n\nMy personal theory is that MDR is a way of encoding a consciousness which can then be transferred in some other form, while this could be an AI, that would require a level of technology not consistent with what we have seen elsewhere and hasn't been foreshadowed in anyway. More likely the encoding provides the transfer to another person, with MDR either removing /&gt;!culling!&lt; the previous individual's thoughts to be replace, or encoding a known/Kier family consciousness for transfer to another.\n\nThere's definitely no robots or clones, nothing seen so far suggests any of this type of technology or even close exists in the outie world.\n\n**Sleep and the concept of innie and outie:** How can you have two different individuals in the same mind coexist? We already do in the sleep state, which rarely cross over with dreams being remembered. The severance chips create a waking dream state while retaining access to senses and motor function. &gt;!Irving is the only person we have seen close to sleep in innie mode when there is a tiny bit of cross over to his outside experience. The door he paints in the real world would then be something he sees in a regular dream. !&lt;The question is then are those that are severed able to dream at all?\n\nSorry for the long post, I've also thoughts on why there is such an elaborate belief system construct in the innie environment but that'll maybe do for next time.",

Or maybe not.  It's hard to know how weird the endgame for this show is going to be.  A part of me would not be disappointed if we discovered that Kier had evolved to some kind of Eldritch horror, and Lumen was just the mad-dream of Azathoth after binging the Office.  \n\nObviously the show's endgame will be more lowkey than all that.  I just love the ambiguous sense of dread lurking through this show. It really captures that trapped feeling I've always had whenever forced to partake in any corporate wellness/bonding nonsens, not to mention how vaguely culty it feels towing that company line. I'd absolutely have undergone the severance procedure if ever given the opportunity, without ever considering the consequences.",

Thrashed together with precise magnetism to draw, draw, draw you in...not to the show, but the highlights. For this, is highlights of the western man/woman. Highlights of a civil society for a small, loud, powerful, impactful, annoying, world destroying, influence making minority. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is Office Space without any room for laid back cynicism, but full ground given to innocence of realised humour....and realised hell.    \n\n\noooh boy, I tell ya, episode 8. Pretty damn solid. Great series thus far. I'm enjoying it.   \n\n\n  \nI look forward to musing over further episodes without the internet (well engrained text based forum filling my minutes post). \n\nAlso, Patricia Arquette deserves, at the very least, a Meryl Streep Kramer Vs.

The philosophical premise of the show is strong enough to hold its own - what if you can halve your mind, what if a corporation controlled it, who are you once you're severed - but Stiller's too antic to really explore any of this.

I think Ambrose succeeded Kier, then did something to get \u201cbanned.\u201d Then Myrtle, who was hellbent on becoming the first woman CEO, had a short run and died the same year as her \u201cretirement\u201d from CEO. Some shit went down, clearly. The OG handbook isn\u2019t the same theme as the newer ones, Dylan is \u201crespectful as fuck\u201d for all the other Eagans, drops the act at Kiers house. The theme is there if you look for it.  \n\nSo I say Cobel is Myrtles granddaughter, or she just got indoctrinated by going to the school founded by Myrtle during her time as CEO based on the year. If some shit went down with the changing of the guards after Myrtles death/retirement including Lumens original core values, then a coup from Myrtles line makes complete sense to me.",

It referenced classic horror movie trailers, and went \"No one will be admitted during the chilling \\_\\_\\_ scene\"; fill in the blank with \"standing around\", \"waiting for the bus\", Etc. \n\nSo, it occurred to me that in any other series or movie, \"putting syrup on waffles\" would fit that gag perfectly. Yet here we are, with a series where someone, somehow, filled a short sequence of preparing a breakfast food with a sense of impending doom.\n\nIf that's not genius, I'm not sure what is.

This rather unsettling possibility was laid bare in the episode with Dylan's \"overtime contingency\" in the closet.\n\nBasically, the protocols are software, the chip is hardware.  My thinking is that reintegration means disabling the hardware.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Further, I suspect somewhere down the line we will find out that Lumon intentionally engineered the chip so that physical extraction of the chip either renders the recipient incapacitated or dead.

They certainly wouldn\u2019t tell them to not react.\n\nHowever, I think Lumon understands that emotions can carry between the two identities; Petey confirms this when he said he could see Outie Mark\u2019s pain in Inner Mark. And even beyond that, if we consider nature vs. nurture, it\u2019s not too surprising if an Innie is drawn to similar things as their Outie.\n\nWe still don\u2019t really understand the purpose of the Wellness meetings. They may be diagnostic, especially with Ms. Cobel placing the candle, watching with baited breath that Mark remembers during his last session, etc., but my impression is that that is only Cobel\u2019s interest and not Lumon\u2019s. That also explains why Milchick questioned her order.\n\nMy guess is that the Wellness checks are actually meant to strengthen the Severance by anchoring the Innie consciousness. That\u2019s why Irving needed one after he started seeing the black goo drip down the walls (which we now know is paint). Of course, this also implies that Lumon really knows how fragile the Severance process really is, which would also partly explain why they fired Cobel.",

That was apparent to me when she found Ricken\u2019s book on Mark\u2019s porch and brought it in to work and told Milchik who it belongs to and how she found it. As to why her personality is so different inside vs outside, I\u2019m not sure. Imo, I think she believed so fully and completely in how severance was supposed to work and support Kier Egan\u2019s cause that she is acting as though she is severed. Sort of a fake it till you make it sort of thing. \n\nI think deep down, she wants reintegration to be possible for some reason that we don\u2019t yet know. Her studying Mark\u2019s wellness sessions and becoming emotional about their interactions; her snooping around in Mark\u2019s personal life; and Graner suggesting that Petey\u2019s reintegration was cause for celebration; Selvig\u2019s happily emotional response to Mark mention of quitting.

Most of the Eagans died the year they stepped down. \n\nThen Cobel worships Kier specifically, and clearly is upset about loss of a relative to their faulty tubing (or some other coma related thing, TBD). She attended a school founded by Myrtle during her reign, and has a red headed doll in the couple on her bed. Imogen, Myrtle were both red heads.  Burt refers to the older Kier ways, educated others about Ambrose.\n\nI posted a whole theory in \u201cridiculous theories you didn\u2019t post\u201d thread about how much all of the characters names and other elements all come back to William the Conqueror.  It\u2019s a nutty theory, but the pattern sealed itself in my mind when Devon and Rickon names their baby Eleanor. Between that being synonymous with Helena/Helly, one origin of it meaning \u201cother Aenor\u201d when Eleanor of Aquitaine\u2019s mother Aenor named her.  Eleanor is also William the Conquerors mothers name. \n\nWilliam the conquerors third son was named William. Same as severed preggo politician lady, had she had the naming rights. \n\nEven William the Conqueors first born son who he had a tumultuous relationship with and lost a battle to, was named Robert. After their father died, Roberts brothers took Normandy from him and locked him away for the rest of his life. \n\nBurt=Ambrose",

I could see one of their goals being to resurrect him in the form of an AI.\n\nA cult around an AI reminds me of Roko's basilisk\n\nSome other things:\n\n - People have to record a sincere sounding apology in the break room. Who are they apologizing to? Maybe it's an attempt to help the future selves of the employees avoid punishment by the AI for not cooperating.\n - Milchick takes pictures of the employees all the time. I don't think The Board cares about those pictures and the outies aren't supposed to know about what happens on the inside, so why record things that nobody wants to see? Perhaps it's to document the commitment of everyone to the building of the AI. \n - The chips in people's heads could also be used for an AI to learn from a real human brain.\n - The theme around one version of a person having to suffer due to the choices of another version of the same person. Innies suffer on the job due to outies making the choice to go to work. The severed version of the pregnant lady has to suffer through the birth process on behalf of her non-severed version.",

I think she's higher up in the chain and maybe at the top. In the flash we see her in a real deep blue dress which is representative of the colour scheme of Lumon. I'm thinking she severed herself to actually see if Severance works and that she can't you know lead by example.\n\nWhen she's innie Helly we've seen her wear different colours that contrast with the Lumon office in the first few episodes which showed her bolder streak and defiance but each episode it started to become toned down. In this week's episode we see her wear a light blue outfit and then in the flash it's bright blue so think something is going to happen there and it'll be a big realisation for Helly.",

I\u2019m basing this partly on the medical tubing with the name that we saw her hugging while destroying her shrine - work isn\u2019t just work, it\u2019s the means for her to get her daughter back - and partly on her absolutely over the top devotion to Kier. \n\nCobel is so invested in Mark\u2019s reintegration because she\u2019s hoping that her daughter will be able to recognize her and they can have that relationship, at least inside the building.

That hallway was so creepy that she had to walk down and Milchiks darkened face features as she walked away. So creepy \n-THE CREEPY HALLWAY MS CASEY WALKS DOWN IS THE PAINTING IRVING WAS PAINTING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE. ALL BLACK WITH A RED DOT IN THE MIDDLE \n-A man who\u2019s mind is as sharp as his incisors that\u2019s funny \ud83d\ude06 \n-this trippy egg party.. The egg party is coveted as fuckkk \n-Cobel is fired and the board responded! \n-interesting how Irving was always interested in the art and it turns out he\u2019s a painter \n-you\u2019re easy to pretend to care about \ud83e\udd7a\n-PAGE 197 SLAPS\n-Ok kids let\u2019s find out what\u2019s for dinner \ud83e\udd7a\n-Yayyy I\u2019ve been waiting for this kiss! \n-Is the gala doing to put a huge damper on their plan bc the innnies don\u2019t know that it\u2019s happening and is it happening at their facility? \n-saddest and creepiest waffle party ever. Music is epic though!\n-So mark is going to awaken with Selvig/Cobel there with him! \n-Dylan did it! It seems like Irving is aware of some parts going on inside. How much exactly?\n-Also Helly is TOTALLY DRESSES FOR A GALA! \n\nThank you all \u263a\ufe0f if you\u2019re interested here the TikTok I talked about [TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZTdu2Xw4G/)",

      "body": "After reading the Macro Data Refining Manual that is included in the Lexington letter, I basically agree.  The numbers are all addressed with hexadecimal codes instead of decimal Cartesian coordinates that reminds me of memory addresses in a buffer, within computer memory.  As this represents some kind of data that they are \u201crefining\u201d, and the way in which they do that is to classify them in bins, and each bin contains some preset combination of the four humors, my guess is that each bin represents a particular experience stored on some Lumon chip.  What I don\u2019t get is that the system tells the employee if they classified the numbers incorrectly.  This implies that the system already knows the correct classification, so it is unclear what the MDR employee is actually adding to the process, besides perhaps additional \u201cintuitive\u201d weight. But because the system knows categorically which classifications are right and wrong, I don\u2019t see what the refining actually helps accomplish even with \u201cintuitive weight\u201d added.  If the system *didn\u2019t* know what the correct bin was beforehand, I would say the process seems like the MDR employee are training an artificial intelligence/machine learning system to more accurately classify memories that are experienced through the mediation of an implanted Lumon severance chip, so that people can be surveilled from within their own memories.  Perhaps they are not training the system, but simply providing oversight or QC, clearing the data for real-world usage.  A curious thing about the \u201cLexington letter\u201d is that the writer, a former MDR worker named Peggy K, connects a bombing that kills people at a certain time in the afternoon, with the 100% completion of a single file exactly two minutes before that bombing occurred.  Maybe the data isn\u2019t for surveillance, but rather for interrogation.  IDK what to make of it, but I definitely feel you are on the right track with the memory addressing being connected both to computer memory and the mind\u2019s memory.",

No outie would complain or ask questions about getting to go home early from work, especially on what I would presume was a Friday because who throws a gala on a weeknight? \n\nThis allows Lumon to account for any one of them earning the waffle party.

Popular in Australia in the 1960s and '70s, these great-tasting hors d'oeuvres are making a comeback.\n\nhttps://www.goodfood.com.au/recipes/jill-dupleixs-devilled-eggs-20140408-36ait\n\n'The\u00a0melon ball drink\u00a0is said to have been first served at a launch party in Studio 54. Studio 54 was the place to be back in the \u201970s. All the A-list celebrities went there to see and be seen.'\nThe Melon Ball is like a party in a glass.\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://onthegas.org/drink/melon-ball\n\nWaffles entered popular US consciousness around the mid 60s, so you'd maybe expect it to be a everyday household product by the 70s. The role of \ud83e\uddc7 \ud83e\uddc7  is to show how infantile the innies are treated with their childish rewards in the workplace. Not sure most people want their bonuses to come in the form of a breakfast/dessert food \ud83e\udd23\n\nIn the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle, waffles were among the most popular snacks, and waffle bars reported long lines. Still, they only turned into a massive craze two years later.\nhttps://manyeats.com/history-of-waffles/\n\nESPECIALLY the music experience dance scenes with Milchick in a white turtleneck. The references between music, design and food do reference the 70s pretty explicitly. Plus Ben Stiller is probably around 50 somethig  years old. So he will have grown up in the 70s and hitting his 20s around the end of the decade, no doubt the writers and numerous professionals working on it will have their references in Kubrick (famouly obsessional about details) and 70s science fiction.

Last episode was so clearly an indication of how she wanted Mark to overcome Lumon programming and ask Casey introspective questions.\n\nWhy does she want to go against Lumon doctrine? She wants a coup d'etat. Or a regime change. She wants to overturn the board. Or get into it. Rise to the top. She wants change. Not necessarily good change. Perhaps she feels Lumon has lost touch with Kier's true intentions. Perhaps it's power, perhaps it's principle, perhaps it's fanaticism. Now Mark wants to do something. Deprive Lumon of Mark. She encourgaes this bc somehow this aids in her purpose. His leaving is a tool to her. It furthers her goal. If he ultimately gets free, or if this causes him to die, is probably irrelevant to her. It pushes her own agenda forward and thats all that matters.",

My thought last night is the data refinement department are possibly refining themselves.  When data refiner finds a group of numbers they represent one of the tempers - because they feel different things when they look at the numbers.  By dragging the numbers into boxes they are balancing their own tempers WO, FC, DR, MA.\n\nThe question is are they balancing their outies or their innies or both ?\n\nIt\u2019s also obvious now that the severance technology that Kieran invented to tame your tempers is also being used for mind control and other nefarious purposes - like creating MK Uktra mind control Slaves.  \n\nThere\u2019s lots of mirrors in the show\nRicken to me mirrors Kier Egan - he is mysterious and does strange things like hanging kelp",

Is it possible there are two Milchicks? It could be that he has severance settings that account for all this but the show hasn\u2019t sewn up the fact that the Overtime encounter with innie/outtie Dylan likely required an extra operator we haven\u2019t met for the second switch... I don\u2019t have as high of a conviction in my suggestions as my suspicions, so I\u2019m curious if anyone else was going down this rabbit hole and has any ideas that might track what we\u2019ve seen so far",

My first guess is that Lumon used their chip to successfully reanimate her and she's been living as an innie who's outie is restricted from leaving the premises.\n\nThe next obvious leap would be that Lumon has been working on the code for eternal life.  Not sure that's where the show is going, but it crossed my mind.\n\nEDIT -- and if we don't take what the show is presenting at face value vis a vis Mark's wife's car crash, then we would have to question everything they've shown us from Mark's outtie point of view.  Which would be very cool.",

Ms Cobel knows that Lumon plans on reviving Kier once the technology is perfected and hopes that once Kier is revived, he would remember her and love her (explaining why she hoped Mark S or Ms Cassey would remember the love they had for eachother). Now that Ms Cobel knows that it doesn't work and that she's been fired, she lost all hope for Lumon. What do you guys think?",

After this latest episode, I really think this could be the true purpose of the severance chip.\n\nI've been thinking about what we've seen so far on the Severed floor at Lumon, and how they could possibly connect to each other and make sense.\n\nWhy would a company be raising goats, 3D printing seemingly random objects, and have a dept picking out numbers in spreadsheets based on emotion?\n\n&amp;gt;!Kier Eagan believed that if you could master \"the four tempers\" that you would master yourself and the world. I think that's the key here, the Lumon cult around Kier is all based on his teachings and beliefs, and  the company basically  worships him.The Severance chip is tracking and mapping these four tempers, or emotional regions, of the brain.!&amp;lt;\n\n&amp;gt;!Each of the departments we've seen so far are doing different activities that lets the chip read the emotional response in a person's brain, and then map each region and how it reacts.The person being severed is critical to getting pure unbiased data of how the activities they are performing make them feel.!&amp;lt;\n\n&amp;gt;!Lumon doesn't just want to control what people are allowed to remember, they want to control what people feel.!&amp;lt;\n\n&amp;gt;!MDR is performing cerebral work that creates a feeling based on the numbers, what they're doing isn't really important, it's not the point.

But my working theory is this:\nMaybe we are in present day or near present day or 5-12 yrs in the future. Whichever the case, it takes place 5-12 years after a near/partial apocalypse that has to some degree depopulated the planet (probably involving famine at some point). The price of gasoline at Petey\u2019s death scene was like $1-$2/gallon (unless they were priced in liters), and in general the atmosphere feels sparse with humanity. The busted out greenhouse in the first episode might have just been a poetic tone setter but might also have served as a clue in plain sight. The idea that a company like Lumon would start taking over all industries would also be more likely in a scenario where the world had been teetering on extinction, and they leveraged their massive scale to price out competition and sadly earned unworthy consumer brand trust from the savings. And maybe the secretive nature of the severance work is to keep hidden how they maintain(ed) their operating margins. Btw, the film version of Soylent Green was set in 2022",

I could be completely reaching but...\n\n\n\nSANGUINE/Helly - her being introduced socially influences how they're eventually inspired to try and figure out what's going on. It seemed like they'd been working well for quite a while before Petey \"left\". She initially has quite a hysterical reaction to first becoming an inniue with the suicide attempt etc.\n\n\nCHOLERIC/Dylan - don't know if this one fits as well, but does like to dominate the others in that he brags about having more finger traps, winning more perks etc.\n\n\nMELANCHOLIC/Mark - outie mark obviously depressed about his loss, which still shows on his innie (as petey mentioned). I think his innie also fits the other descriptors (/Avoiding/Conscientiousness/Cautious)\n\n\nPHLEGMATIC/Irving - Schizoid, like when he almost falls asleep and his outies consciousness seeps in with those schizophrenic type hallucinations.

He lives in Lumen with his wife(Ms. Casey) who only severs every so often for wellness sessions. \n\nCobel was sent to keep an eye on clone-Mark to make sure he doesn\u2019t have any sort of memory of everything.

Mark being the \u201cboard\u201d and not speaking would make sense because if they were keeping it from Cobel she would have recognized his voice when he spoke.

Instead, she's an attempt at resurrection of Gemma. They are trying her out by letting her interact with the severed workers a few hours at a time. \n\nBut the procedure is either incomplete or not very successful, which is why she seems to lack some human qualities- she is affectless and unable to interact normally with other people. \n\nSo she's 'fired' and sent back to be tested and either replaced with a new attempt, or maybe....refined? \n\nThe other part of this is Corbel- the shrine to Kier with the breathing tube labelled Charlotte Corbel- could be that a relative (her mother?) died and then Lumon either promised to bring her back, or else successfully did so. Which would explain Harmony's religious devotion to Kier.\n\nPerhaps the chips record data that can be used after death to recreate someone's personality. When they have Petey's chip, Corbel and Milchick talk about it as being Petey, as if the chip contained Petey's essence somehow. So maybe we'll see Petey (or some version of him) again at some point. \n\nMaybe the ultimate aim is to resurrect Kier and they are experimenting with others to perfect the technique.",

Paintings all black, black goo, he is painting the elevator DOWN to where Ms. Casey went (will go?) Heavy metal plays. Ace of Spades Mot\u00f6rhead. Frantic painting, all black, leaving one bare wood center till he covers it up. We look out of the painting as he covers the blank\r  \n\\-our MCs all in elevator, arriving at work montage. \r  \n\\-Helly is deep in concentration trying to finish her file before the deadline. -everyone is nervous, Milchick and Cobel are watching from computer camera remotely, nervous. \r  \n\r  \n\\-Cobel tells Milchick that she wants Mark to have an End of Quarter wellness session for Mark. Milchick is skeptical. Cobel tells him mr grande sits with keir now and they are satisfied with him. Clearly this has deep meaning for both of them\r  \n\r  \n\\-Helly gets a cheesy \u2018inspirational\u2019 computer vid of kier as reward. Kier flies away\r  \n\\-Mark meets with Cobel for the EOQ review I guess.  Very awkward laughing Cobel and Mark. So weird. \r  \n\\-one person can stay for the waffle party.

Her fave was the 8 hours she spent in their dept. \r  \n\\-Mark offers again to help, she asks why he cares. He says they are people not parts of people. Cobel is watching. She seems to approve of what he\u2019s saying. \r  \n\\-It is revealed that Milchick is there too, watching the wellness session. He says it\u2019s good that they don\u2019t remember each other. Cornel with seeming suppressed rage tells Milchick to \u201ctake her back down, to the testing floor\u201d. \r  \n\\-Milchick sends casey down long dark hallway to elevator shown in Irving\u2019s painting\r  \n\\-Mark goes back to MDR, they briefly discuss plan, Milchick gives them a \u201cpre-waffle-party egg bar\u201d Dylan will get his waffle party at close of day\r  \n\\-Dylan requested something specific for his extra gift, we don\u2019t see what it is as he opens the box.

She wants to explain to the board at the gala that night. No-go, she has to leave. \r  \n\\-at the Egg party again, Irving selects a Lumon book from the wall alcove. Compliance. Searches for passage, summary of the passage: do all things well because you are doing them for kier. Smashes an egg in the book at this passage.\r  \n\\-Helly jokes to Mark that the goats lay the eggs. They talk about being scared of getting caught. Helly says it\u2019ll be ok. \r  \n\\-They have a moment where they admit they care about each other \r  \n\\-Milchick ends the party because he has vague management issues to deal with. He will return to escort Dylan to waffle party \r  \n\\-Milchick escorts Cobel out. He is cold and impersonal but underneath seems affected \r  \n\\-\u201cSVRD\u201d threshold restricted (door sign) as Cobel is leaving.\r  \n\r  \n\\-why does Dylan want to be the one to operate the protocol so bad? (my question)\r  \n\r  \n\\-back in MDR, Mark reads a passage out of Ricken\u2019s book for inspiration to carry out their plan to waken their outies).

Directed at \u201cher\u201d (Originally thought her was Natalie, but then decided that was assuming too much. Irv refers to Lumon as \u201cher\u201d in E4(?)).

Seeing macrodata come together as a team has been so beautiful. I'm just in awe of the way this show has unfolded. It's delivered hard while presenting more questions and mystery the whole time. They struck a perfect balance imo.\n\nThis was last episode, but Burt's retirement party scene introduced me to one of the most beautiful songs I'd never heard before. That scene blew my mind because of how well the music matches the mood. \n\nI can't get enough of this show and I'll be very sad at the end of the finale, so let's enjoy this final ride of anticipation!",

It also speaks to how there\u2019s so much pain and dominance referenced with a taming of who you are as seemingly the only way to exist.\n\nNot sure if anyone else made this connection but it\u2019s definitely fun go rewatch episodes and I feel inspired by all the brilliant posts on here!\n\nEdit: spelling",

I\u2019ve browsed the sub, but haven\u2019t researched these theories in depth, so I apologize if these have been mentioned a bunch already. \n\nFirst, I think Dylan *might* die in the finale. I thought his gift choice may have been something to help him hold the switches, but we see it\u2019s their group photo. He could still end up using this in some way, but part of me thinks the explanation is more simple: they\u2019re showing us his love for the team and his feelings about having a son so that we\u2019re *devastated* by his death. As of now, he doesn\u2019t have many loose story threads compared to the rest of MDR. Mark is the main character. Helly is likely who the community thinks she is. Irv obviously has knowledge of the testing floor and is starting to bleed thoughts over between his two sides. Aside from general intrigue, the only thread I can think of for Dylan is why he hears what he hears in the Break Room. That could be explained in a brief flashback as he dies, or he may very well live and have a lot of story left to tell. Something about the end of the last episode just makes me think we might be losing him soon. \n\nMy second theory is just tinfoilhattery and likely very wrong, but I don\u2019t think Alexa is a Lumon plant. I think she\u2019s working specifically with Cobel to pursue reintegration. I\u2019m not convinced they\u2019re both working with Reghabi, but simply have a shared interest.",

I think we've been thrown a bunch of cleverly and well placed red herrings (that, for the most part, it appears everyone has bought into). I'm going to put together a post outlining some theories with the details and info to support them. In short, I think Helly and Mark are at the same party. I think quite possibly that Ricken and Devon's party is the 'Eagen Family Gala\". I believe Helly is someone of stature and importance, but not an Eagen, and not a board member. I feel like we are in for a huge reveal that will stand the show on its head. Mark and Devon have a few exchanges throughout the season that stand out as odd or peculiar (will detail in post to come). I think there's a chance that Devon, the one person in Mark's life who appears to offer Mark warmth, love, and consideration, is the exact opposite of what she appears to be. In fact, she may be someone of significance and importance in regards to Lumon and/or the Eagens.",

He used to be milchek or graner. His full name is **Irving Bailiff**, as in the individual responsible for keeping order/watching prisoners. Lastly, his profile on the LinkedIn page says he has been working at lumon for 9 years, but we know he has only been severed for 3. He must have been the old milchek, or maybe the old graner. Milchek took ms casey down, but we don't know if that would have been graner's job had he still been around. \n\nHe also easily could have been the one who physically painted the art pieces we see around the office, explaining his interest in them almost like he is proud of his work but doesn't know its his work. \n\nHe could have also been the guy previously in charge of the goats, and remembers the elevator because when the goats are \"ready\" they go down to testing to do god knows what. He did show medical knowledge after the MDE that could mean he was previously involved in the testing side of things. \n\nThere is also a popular theory (that is probably the most likely) that burt and irving worked together in O&amp;D or another department previously and were reset/branch transferred due to love beating severance but that has been mentioned multiple times so i wont go into too much detail. They wouldn't give the role of Burt G to someone like christopher walken if there wasn't more to the story. \n\nthoughts?",

I hadn't considered what her role was at Lumon, but her being a scientist would explain why she was sent downwards to testing in the elevator. Maybe she was being sent to testing not so her outie could be tested on, but so her outie could perform testing.",

Lumon had dealt with the situation by retiring Devon. \\[OutieDevon, not knowing any better, assumes the child is get from her idiot husband.\\] Months later, Lumon realizes Petey is the father and, as they prepare to fire him, the rebel neurotech at Lumon realizes that he is the perfect candidate for reintegration. She get permission from outie *and* innie Petey \\[because she does believe that inniePetey is a person with rights\\] to reintegrate. They agree because 1. inniePetey knows of the pregnancy and wants to see that mother and baby are alright - and not knowing Devon has a partner \\[how could he know - she didn't know\\] he thinks maybe they could become a family - if outieDevon keeps the child. 2. outiePetey agrees because he wamts to know why he was fired - maybe he was even told he violated policy and hearing  the rumor that an unidentified woman at Lumon became pregnant - he wonders if there's a connection.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In terms of the timeline, Mark could have started his job at Lumon and innieMark would have no idea he was working with his sister and vice versa \\[although outieDevon might have know she recommended Mark join her on Lumon's payroll after grief over the loss of Ms. Casey made him unable to keep his job at the university\\]. Maybe Devon was hired while they had a program/experiment to have three personalies - outieDevon, implanted memories of a fake day of work at Lumon as an unsevered employee, and - what she was actually doing all day -as - unknown to outieDevon, an innieDevon. So, she, Ricken and Mark have no idea she is a severed employee - and thus it doesn't come as a topic of conversation at one of Ricken's undinner parties.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;God, this wild speculation is like crack...once you start you don't want to stop.

Selvig/Coval is an imposing, mysterious boss and a cooky, widowed neighbour, both coded to be much more than 5 years older than Mark, whereas the actor playing Ms Casey is 10 years younger than Adam Scott, and the one playing Helly is 13 years younger. Not to mention that Devon being a first time mom probably isn\u2019t older than 35, and her and Mark don\u2019t really have the dynamic of siblings super far apart in age. Mark is probably supposed to be in his late thirties or very early fourties rather than 50, and Selvig may be older than Patricia Arquette. I recently saw another mystery show where the identity of a character was central to the plot, but it the actor playing her was 20 years younger than the character, making it impossible to figure out. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here, I hope not. Casting a 54 year old woman to play 78 would be offensive (unless there is an in universe explanation).",

I know that they don\u2019t take their memories onto the severed floor, but I feel that more has to be adjusted for Mark in order to make him that chipper, childlike man boy. I feel like his personality has been dialed back to a more innocent time, before he had memories of this car accident and maybe even Gemma. Helly just has to be herself but lacking any personal information. Mark needs to be himself without any personal information and without crippling depression disassociating him from his immediate environment. I know that the depression is only there because of the loss he\u2019s experienced which is contained in his memories, but he might now have to know the details to stay sad. I think that his brain has to be altered a bit more than Helly\u2019s is order for him to be a productive person. In order for him not to be depressed at work, shouldn\u2019t they supplement the implant with a blast of serotonin to his innie brain so that he can function better? Our depression isn\u2019t just there because it\u2019s tied to our bad experiences; it\u2019s also reinforcing itself by causing our brains to function differently.",
