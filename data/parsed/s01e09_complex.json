All in all a great episode, that advanced the plot nicely.  I didn't really expect the overtime contingency to last the whole episode - I was expecting it to only last a few minutes, and hence largely fail in their attempt, but to set up the plot for them to try again.  I think that is a good thing, too - it means they have enough of an interesting story to tell that they don't need to pad it out with a whole season of failed attempts to activate the overtime contingency....\n\nRight, off to watch it again.",

Unfortunately i don't think marks brother in law is going to get the message and as soon as marks outie switches on, he'll try and pretend it was nothing. Although his sister now knows so it will be interesting to see how that plays out and whether she convinces mark to quit and if i recall mark did say he was thinking about leaving. Hellys speech is probably not going to have any impact on severance and they'll sweep it under the rug and maybe just pretend it was a joke. Burts outie doesn't know irving so by the time the door opens, his outie will have switched on and won't remember why he's there but this might lead to them actually getting to know one another. I'm curious what will happen to dylan and how Lumon will look to resolve this. Perhaps using one of the other commands that can wipe memories and do other things we don't know yet. Helly being an eagan was predictable and many people said as much only a few episodes in but her segment was still really good.\n\nAs for Gemma, i don't think that's actually marks wife at Lumon, she might only be \"alive\" through severance and the real gemma maybe was braindead after the accident and this was a way to keep her alive and a permanent worker at Lumon or someone they can freely test on that isn't legally alive. So if mark wants to \"rescue\" her, she will have to be permanently severed while outside of Lumon otherwise her brain might not be functional or she may be comatose. Dylan took one for the team and sacrificed seeing his son/family so the other 3 could get a chance on the outside. I really dislike mrs selvig/cobalt, at first i thought she was going to help mark go against Lumon but she sees an opportunity to get back in by exposing them to Lumon and how convenient that marks innie switched on right as he's hugging her. I did expect that we wouldn't really be getting any answers and instead would be asking more questions than we already had prior to this episode. Overall a great finale and now we will have to wait for atleast a year for the next series.",

We see Irving with a list of names, and those names mapped out at across the town of Kier. Plus more effort in trying to identify others like an investigator. But why is he doing this? Why is he severed? PTSD coping seems like an easy answer for becoming severed, but the secret list of other severed people and mapping their locations does not add up with that. We also know that Irving has been severed for a *much* longer time than the others (at least 2 years? Idk I'd have to rewatch).\n\nWe also see Helly's father remind her of the severed tech having blue and green lights, and young Helly childishly told him \"they are so pretty, everyone should have them\". Given Helly's age now, that hints that this tech has been around for a while.\n\nBut the public hasn't been all that exposed to the severance procedure for an extended period of time.\n\nWhat if the severance procedure was initially developed for use in war? You have enlisted soldiers that are easily indoctrinated to do your will, and they have no recollection or PTSD after their tour is complete. Irving would have been involved with this severeance program as a soldier, and it explains why his so interested in secretly tracking down other people. I believe there was speculation last episode that you could wipe the memories of an innie due to the executable options besides the overtime procedure. Irving's wartime innie was wiped, and then a new one was made for Lumon. This general use case for combat soldiers also may explain the combat cards made in O&amp;D.",

No way. \n\nBut even if you wipe the minds of the innies, there were SO many people around Helly and around Mark that they\u2019d know something was up right? \n\nUnless Devon immediately pulls Mark aside when he wakes up and then the rest of the party guests are just frazzled by the baby incident. But then all eyes would be on \u201cSelvig\u201d like the guests would all be talking about that right? \n\nAnd The Helly portion could MAYBE be played off as a joke had she not been tackled. \n\nAnd then I\u2019m guessing maybe outtie Irv has seen and maybe met Burt before, but maybe Burt is content with his Lumon time and thinks Irv is a weirdo?

No fuck that, his first instinct is to **unlock a chest in the closet**?????\n\n- Skipping Mark\u2019s sister\u2019s initial reaction to finding out he\u2019s innie Mark, i mean just come on. **Come on**. There are times where you do that because the audience can put two and two together (ironic considering what issue #1 was) and there are times where you don\u2019t specifically for the sake of satisfying moments. This was definitely the latter.\n\nThe quality of this show has been consistent for **eight** episodes. What **in the hell** happened?? Idk if they had their episode count cut and just had to make some shit work or what. I mean they set up a super interesting cliffhanger, but at what cost?",

Like the innie is severed rather than the outtie?\nWhat if the characters we've been seeing are innies^n? \n\nSo there are multiple iterations of the innies (which seems to be what the opening sequence is hinting at), but we don't really know who the \"real\" person is? Maybe we've never even seen a \"real\" outtie, and the people in the town are actually all innies without realizing it?\n\n\nThis might explain some of the time gaps going on, since there's more than two layers of consciousness for some/all of the characters?\nAlso, with Irv mapping out the town...it's giving me Petey mapping out the severed floored/building vibes.\n\n\nAgain, not sure if these questions have been brought up before!

Then we see this shot of the ginger running and jumping into the ambulance and he says \"Hey, Hap\" or something to that effect, and Hap's face is like \"Oh, not you again!\"!&lt;\n\nThen it got canceled!\n\nVampires (French Netflix): &gt;!We've been told all season that the MC's dad is dead from a vampire feud. Then we find out he was a geneticist, and actually married her mom and had her to experiment on them in order to discover the vampire secret because it's an illness in this show. Then, in the last episode, we found out that he's been alive all this time, and the MC's half-bro has kept him prisoner. Turns out, Dad turned himself into a vampire.!&lt;\n\nIt's in limbo because of COVID, because I haven't heard of it being canceled yet.\n\nI Am Not Okay With This (Netflix): &gt;!MC has psychic powers. Turns out they're genetic. Has a hard time at school, and figuring out if she likes her friend romantically or not. Slowly figures out powers with help of other friend. Turns out some shady shadow-creature is following her because of her dad. Cue Carrie-style Prom after being forced out of the closet, and she runs to the nearby fire-tower or whatever. Prepares to jump off said tower because of Carrie Prom, meets shadow-creature, and he wants to recruit her to a X-Men organization.!&lt;\n\nIt got canceled, supposedly because of COVID.\n\nIn the Flesh (BBC): &gt;!After the zombie apocalypse, Zombies are being cured. Kieran Walker returns home to a conservative English countryside town of Roarton. Meets fellow Cured Zombies and discovers dead boyfriend is alive. Adventures ensue, and due to boyfriend's dad's internalized zombie and homophobia, murder-suicide occurs. Cue Kieran having a second mental breakdown, but ultimately stays alive because his fam is there for him.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Season 2 starts, and times are a-changing. Gov't enforces indentured servitude upon the Cured (I forgot what they're actually called.) and a handsome Second Rising priest (They believe zombies are miracles and more will come soon) comes to town in search of the Chosen One. And Kieran's Cured friends are also brewing trouble. Cue quick romantic development of Kieran x priest, and a town civil war because of said trouble. Cured friend is shot by priest because she might be the Chosen One (\"if CO dead, then zombies rise\"), show ends.!&lt;\n\nCanceled due to channel getting revamped.",

Helly was vindictive enough to try and time her suicide so her outie would be the one to die and realize who was responsible. I am convinced that Helena is just as driven to make sure Helly suffers. Instead of stopping her work on the Helly story, she is going to continue to work at Lumon and make sure she is suffering inside to punish her. \n\nCobel will go on a power trip, thinking that her intervention is what stopped the innies from doing any real damage, so she should get her job back. Milchick will probably become floor supervisor in the interim. Cobel, Milchick, or whoever is put in charge will send the innies to the testing floor to presumably torture them somehow. \n\nDevon will tell Mark everything, he will be even more driven to find out what is going on and what he meant by \u201cshe\u2019s alive\u201d. He will keep working there and work himself into a craze at the slight chance that Gemma is somewhere right out of his reach.\n\nIrving will wake up to Burt opening the door, both of them confused. He seems to be suspicious of everything going on with the severed workers. He will be driven to understand why his innie went to Burt\u2019s house and that will be his main motivation going forward on the outside.\n\nNot sure what is going to happen with Dylan but I don\u2019t think it will work out well for him. \n\nMy hope is that they explore the color scheme even more. Its been pretty apparent that blue and green are important to Lumon and the Eagans, supported tonight by the story of the first microchip having blue and green lights, as well as Helly being outfitted in both colors. I want them to explore those two, as well as the introduction of red. I think that it can still be subtle while also going into a little more depth, I think something as brief as the microchip lights would be sufficient and wonderful. \n\nVery excited to see what is in store for all of the characters. This show is one of the best I have seen in a very, very long time. Bravo to all involved!",

People who are little new age-y and say things that _feel_ intelligent to them but aren\u2019t particularly substantive if you think about it. Somebody who might change their name on a whim, or somebody who would miss the practical reason why WWI wasn\u2019t called such at the time. The kind of people that would have a \u201cdinner\u201d without food, instead of just saying they\u2019re hanging out or something.  Ricken is the only one of them revealed thus far to have any semblance of self-awareness, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if those in his flock were lacking in that department.\n\nNot to mention most people don\u2019t seem to be aware if their names are changed when they\u2019re severed, so it would be odd for somebody to mention it happening _again_.",

First of all I was surprised when the episode just played at around 22:00 EST! \nAnd then the amazing AMAZING episode.\n\nDidn't give a fuck about so many of the theories and still setting up an amazing story without answering most questions. \n\nSo many amazing things happened in this episode:\n&gt;: When he called her Ms. Cobel! I knew we were in for a ride!!\n\n&gt;: Helena Eagan. Holy fuck is she a brilliant individual. If we are supposed to believe the Lexington Letter, your core kinda remains the same? And she puts all of what's happening together so well. Settles in, observes, and realizes that she has that chance to speak to so many people. Also figures out what's happening when Cobel shows up and still manages to get the word in. \n(Although, the whole figuring out where they are and what they can use to find the way forward was done amazingly by all 3 of them! Sort of made it seem like a young adult in an actual adult body story to me...)\n\n&gt;: I was so scared that Cobel had left with the baby. For a second I wanted her to meet with an accident and not make it to the Gala. (which, in hindsight, could have happened if Irv had run the STOP sign like Cobel did.)\n\n&gt;: The complete Irv outie's story! He has been looking into all this for sooo long. Just imagine if he ends up being a reporter who is trying to come up with the ever illusional answer to the question, \"What is it that they are doing down there?\"\n\n&gt;: Devon is the best kind of human someone can have around them! Seriously! \nIt all started with, \"Our baby!\" She noticed something being off straight away.  \nThen made sure she talked to him at the first observation break. \nSomehow listening to the insane story, had the cool to stay in the moment. \nAnd then actually knowing that journalists would be a better resource to go to, and not the cops. \nShe will 100% figure out what \"She's alive!!\" means!!!\n\n&gt;: And of course the amazing hero, who just wants to remember the birth of his child. Who did not give in to the temptation of, \"You've got two more. I'll tell you their names and any perk you want if you let go of the switches!\"\n\nAnd for the line of the episode I'd like to nominate, \"This better be working you assholes\"\n\nBring on Season 2 please.\n\n\nEdit:\nDamn!!! Completely forgot the Mark S meeting Ricken. Ended up giving a pep talk, unknowingly of course, to his IDOL. Whose book was the last piece that made sure that the Innies banded and went on with this mission.",

All of that, combined with outtie Irv trying to map his town, Ricken's friends not seeming to understand basic stuff about WW1, and more, makes me think that the outer world is in fact some strange Eagan-owned stage and that everyone in it is either a victim, severed or not, or part of the ploy.\n\nDoctors giving out 19th century advice seemed hugely telling. I don't think any of them have free access to media even though it seems like they have internet and television.\n\nI find it strange that none of the characters mention out loud that they live in Kier, including Devon.

It's just fluff before introducing Helena, right?\n\nWelcome to KinkoDigby's theory time!\n\nI think Irving's father had something to do with an earlier research project involving severance technology. Irving wants answers about what they did to his father and so took the job at Lumon to try get answers. This would explain the footlocker items &amp; documents and I think this would play well with each character having a strong family connection/story that implicates their work life. Like work/life balance themes etc. - this could be Irving's family component.\n\nIt's a short theory. Thanks for reading.",

Someone like Ms Casey clearly still has a well functioning brain since she's walking, talking, staying alive without machines, etc. \n\nMaybe in the world of the show Lumon can bring the dead back to life, but my guess/hope would be that if there's something to the theory (and I think there very well could be) it's less dramatic than bringing back someone from brain death.",

It\u2019s possible he\u2019s a single father with just the one kid.

Well-cast, brilliantly-directed and edited, with one of the most spellbinding opening sequences in the recent TV history, \"Severance\" is the perfect blend of Sci-fi, mystery, dystopia, and dark comedic undertones. \"Black Mirror\" is the only comparison that comes to mind but that show falls under the anthology category, therefore \"Severance\" is quite unlike any TV series you've ever seen before. As the mystery unfolds, you can't help but think about the layers upon layers of possibilities and various implications. Each episode takes its time in developing its textured characters, positioning you for a satisfying payoff. Every actor stands out in their own right, from the lead Adam Scott to veterans Patricia Arquette, John Torturo, Christopher Walken to Tramell Tillman as \"Milchick,\" my personal favorite. This show is complex, and so if you want to be entertained and mentally stimulated at the same time, I recommend not waiting to play S1E1!",

Every plot twist felt earned and paid off well because there was very well-placed and subtle foreshadowing that you could find on a rewatch or look back on in retrospect.\n\nHowever, the showrunners got upset that people on the internet figured out some of the twists before they aired, so for S2 they deliberately changed the plot away from what they had planned for the sole purpose of making it sufficiently confusing that people wouldn't figure out their twists ahead of time.\n\nThis had the consequence of making said twists feel unearned and the storytelling more jarring, since you no longer had sufficient information to look back on in retrospect to justify them. It became surprises for the sake of surprise rather than them being earned. It was no longer this super polished and coherent world, but instead just became another TV drama. Not bad in any way, but S1 was damn near a masterpiece so it was a major regression by comparison. S1 is easily one of my favorite pieces of television content of all time while the subsequent seasons were just 7/10 forgettable TV.",

I feel like the Lumon bigwigs have a big stake in not just claiming innies are happy, but in believing it.  Otherwise, why teach them all this Kier philosophy and so on?\n\nAnd since Kier is all about (his hubristic spin on) the Protestant work ethic, it doesn't make a lot of sense for his heirs to believe the people doing the work are not \"real people\".  They should be buying into their own BS.  So obviously Helena was confronted with the reality of her innie's deep unhappiness, but ISTM she would have responded by saying something like \"I understand you're unhappy, but please understand this is all for the greater good, and you and I are a team\", something like that.  Even if she were angry and wanted to unleash a rant against her innie, it's hard to imagine Milchick actually showing the severed workers (not even just Helly!) that video.\n\nSo I consider that a bit of \"fridge logic\" contrivance by the writers.

So that's a way for Lumen to keep those impulses in check..\n\nThe cards seem to indicate violence is either programmed in or possibly they're creating sleeper cells for attacks on competitors, if anyone saw the Lumen letter Apple RV released a few days ago basically confirming that the file names they're working on are connected to near terrorist attacks against their competitors. Especially with fear/scary numbers being the biggest focus over any other emotion - triggering a fight than flight response to a huge surge of that emotion?\n\nNeed to read the book but don't want to spoil the first real mystery plot show of what'll happen next.",

I started it last week and the wait to this finale was unbearable (but I'm glad I didn't need to wait week to week for each episode to come out) I kept counting the minutes left and feeling dread seeing the end of the episode getting closer. But they ended it at the perfect moment to have that cliffhanger ending while still feeling like they resolved some plot threads. If it had ended on a more ambiguous note, it would have been pretty disappointing. \n\nI wasn't sure what I was expecting, but it was cool to see the entire episode play out with the innie's trying to figure things out on the outside. I thought they might have only been out for a few minutes and then their time would get cut short much sooner, with the rest of the episode dealing with the aftermath of that. This was far more tense and stressful to watch than I anticipated. I probably should have stayed away from reddit because the Helly Eagan reveal sort of got \"spoiled,\" and that might have been a little more surprising to see, but then again, maybe not. Given the way the previous episode ends and the way Helly's outie treats her, the reveal almost feels inevitable at that point. \n\nThe wait for season 2 is going to be hell, but hopefully whatever they come up with next lives up to the first season because it's a pretty high bar they've set for themselves. And I hope this is a show that they have a solid endgame in mind for, and not something they plan on running for too many seasons. With this type of story, they need to burn bright and fast, rather than let the show fizzle out slowly over time.",

We only see that image through Ms. Casey. So how would his Innie see it? How would he have seen it enough to burn it into his brain well enough for his Outie to paint over and over? He had to have seen it a lot. Like how Ms. Casey sees it as the end of her existence every time she's activated. She's lived 100ish hours in half hour segments so she would have seen that elevator over 200 times in her short life.

      "body": "\nWow. What an incredible, marvelously shot and scripted, masterpiece of a finale. Didn\u2019t go the way we were expecting aside from Helly being an Eagan and Mark choosing to confide in Devon. Some massive cliffhangers that beg some questions:\n\n1.\t\u2060Dylan vs. Milchick - I predict Dylan will bash him in the head witch the holographic crystal gift. If not, Dylan may go to the testing room to have his memory wiped or just get wrecked in the break room for an ungodly amount of time.\n2.\t\u2060Helly\u2019s speech ending with her being pulled off stage after telling the audience the innies are tortured - she will be branded as crazy, psychotic, that it was all made up, and the Lumon party attendees (aside from maybe a few) will go along with thinking she\u2019s a nutjob and continue being pro-severance\n3.\t\u2060Irving immediately going to search for Burt - loved it. Although he was sad to see that Burt already has another male partner, he still got to see the love of his life. I love that oBurt is gay too.\n4.\t\u2060Irv turning to outie Irv while banging on Burt\u2019s door - heartbreaking. He\u2019s either going to be confused and humiliated when Burt opens the door, or Burt may remember him, even if only that Irv looks familiar. I always had a feeling Irv\u2019s story would end up being tragic.\n5.\t\u2060Mark realizing Cobel has infiltrated his life and family. This is huge and will play a large role in the sharing of information between cobel, Devon, and outie Mark.\n6.\t\u2060Mark screaming \u201cSHE\u2019S ALIVE!!!\u201d after seeing the picture of Gemma - This will be taken by partygoers and perhaps Devon and Milchick as Eleanor being alive. Perhaps someone will find the wedding picture moves or turned over and realize who he\u2019s talking about. (Edit - I\u2019ve been informed he was holding the picture of Gemma when he said this. Must\u2019ve missed it?)\n7.\t\u2060Cobel stopping Helly - her warning to her that the others will suffer gravely  if she goes through with then speech. This makes me believe she will be a good guy in the end. She may worship Kier, but is no longer loyal to Lumon and has no reason to do things for the good of the company. Notice that she goes straight for Helly rather than the severance floor to help Milchick stop Dylan. Idk. I just really don\u2019t see her as a classic bad guy at the end of all of this. Otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have been encouraging mark to quit at the end of ep8.\n8. Dylan finding out he has more children. If he makes it to the next season, he is going to do whatever he can to get to his family. \n9. Kinda concerned that they\u2019re going to wipe all the current innies\u2019 memories. That would make the plot of season 3 all about Devon, Rickon, and oMark (and possibly the partygoers, plus maybe a few at the gala that believed Helly\u2019s speech) trying to find a way to stop/overthrow Lumon.\n10. Mark is in no way returning to Lumon unless it\u2019s to help the rest of MDR. After Devon relays what his inner told her, I think he\u2019ll spend his time on the outside trying to contact the rest of MDR and Burt - perhaps Reghabi will come into play here and the season will be all about reintegration and trying to create an uprising.",

And it seems like a lot of important plot elements started out as comical absurdities- melon bars, musical dance,  experience, egg bar are (maybe) just photo ops for oHelly\u2019s book. Ms. Casey as a comically bizarre wellness counselor turning out to be Gemma (I bet \u201cenjoy each fact equally\u201d will be significant beyond the humor). Waffle parties and Eagan cult mysticism or whatever. Not that comedy or caricature for its own sake is a waste, but seems like the authors use comedy to focus our attention on significant things.",

The leaders of the cult, including the Eagan family, understand that Severance isn\u2019t good, but they use it as a means to an end.\n\nIn other words, the cult leaders want everyone outside the cult to believe Severance is good, but that doesn\u2019t mean the cult leaders themselves believe it is. Obviously at a minimum Milchick and Cobel understand that the Innies aren\u2019t happy, but both of them still believe in Severance because they\u2019re completely brainwashed by Kier.",

This way \u201cnew learning \u201c doesn\u2019t interfere with previously learned information. I thought maybe if Irving sleeps as an innie, it helps the bleeding over of info to his outie. Also, I thought it was interesting that he could drive. Procedural memory (riding a bike, driving) is performed unconsciously, which is most likely who he knows how to do it as an innie.",

I think that\u2019s part of Irving\u2019s story, and why he is able to paint pictures of the hallway to the break room.\n\nAs lab rats, the innies are too valuable to just cast aside without trying to manipulate them back into obedience.

It\u2019s almost biblical \u2014 the ability to have your past life of sins or whatever wiped clean, but not erasing fallibility that is inherent to being human. \n\nBut religion is a man-made creation. Lumon recognizes that there is an evolutionary basis for a follow-the-leader impulse, which religious leaders have exploited for power. What if Lumon\u2019s end game is to thwart evolution, by temporarily controlling human impulses, as a way for them to achieve global power. \n\nThis makes religion and the cult aspects a means to an end, but not the overall goal of the family and corporation.\n\nI hope aliens or the supernatural never become part of the story, maybe other than a constructed way to manipulate the innies by playing on popular notions of what aliens can do to people.",

This woman is not gaining any free time. While her innie is looking after the children, her outie is nonexistent. The only thing I can think of is that her outie hates parenthood so passionately she wants to go into nonexistence for eight hours a day, or however long she does it. And it seems to me really far-fetched that all but a very tiny few people would feel that strongly in that way, to have a chip installed in their brain just so they can avoid raising their children for a certain number of hours each day. Why not just hire a nanny? Wouldn't that be a gazillion times easier?",

Those inherent personality traits in outie form often belong to leaders, visionaries, powerful people. \nBut on the flip side of that coin, when someone behaves in those same ways when they AREN\u2019T in a position of power, they can be labeled as unhinged or crazy - their innie forms are seen as lesser-than a person and marginalized. So the inherent personality traits that carry over from outie to innie manifest themselves differently, based on their \u201cstatus\u201d as innie vs. outie. And those same identical personality traits are assigned a different value when viewed by others depending on whether you\u2019re an outie (privileged) or an innie (marginalized).\nThere\u2019s a lot of relevance in those themes to our current day lives and world.",

There's just too much for me to process from this episode alone, let alone all the unresolved mysteries all season. Not to mention, I watched this after watching Everything Everywhere All at Once *twice*. I don't think the brain is meant to withstand this amount of mindfuckery in one day.\n\nThis show is so damn smart and it knows exactly how to stretch the tension, much like Dylan holding those switches for an hour. Kudos to all those who predicted that Helly was an Eagan (I'm still trying to figure out what the R. stands for). I don't remember how people originally came to that conclusion; was it just because of how cold her outie was behaving towards her innie, or was there another clue within the early episodes?\n\nThe scene with Mark at the party was masterfully done. I liked how he was able to gather so much intel without arousing too much suspicion (besides the Ms. Cobel slip!). I loved how his sister also accepted it and put it all together. I'm dying because the knowledge that Gemma is Ms. Casey is such a huge bombshell for his innie to process. The fact that it cuts off after \"SHE'S ALIVE\" leads me to think that it won't be enough information for anyone else to go on. Meanwhile, I hope Helly was able to say enough without the Eagans being able to cover up the truth. I'm also so disappointed that Cobel is still loyal to Lumon and Milchick even after being sacked, since she could have made a great ally to Mark.\n\nSince Irving had no one to tell about Lumon, I wish he wrote a detailed note to his outie about what was going on and what he was doing. It's going to be strange when his outie finds himself outside of Burt's residence, and I highly doubt Burt will have any lingering memories of him either. Although it's interesting to note that the innies still retain the part of the brain that knows how to drive. Kind of like riding a bike, it's one of those learned traits you inherently carry.\n\nI'm still very confused about the \"two person system\" that is required for Overtime Contingency. How was Milchick able to release Dylan at his house (and physically be there at the same time), while Dylan has to hold both switches on at the same time? We know that Milchick was working alone, so is there a mobile version of that unit he was using? I can't remember if this was already addressed in a previous episode.\n\nBy the way, do we know why Patricia Arquette was sometimes credited as \"Peggy\" in some early articles and interviews? I thought there might be another left turn coming up, but maybe it's a twist better left for another day.",

I think severance has a subconscious effect on him, which leads to his writing. Part of him knows the world doesn't work the way it appears to work, but he can't consciously wrap his head around it so he struggles to explain it with seaweed rituals and odd self-help writing.\n* I also think Ricken's friends are severed. I think they're awkward because they haven't lived full lives to become well-adjusted. \n* It's highly possible that most of the town residents in Kier are severed. The word \"kier\" is literally \"a vat\" so I think the entire town is an experimentation space for Lumon. \n* It's possible that the severance procedure can not only fork the mind, but bring with it implanted memories or someone else's consciousness entirely. \n* Kier(?) Eagan himself talks about his \"revolving\" and I think we're looking at a Get Out situation (or a FMA:B Greed situation, if you're a weeb). The company is probably on edge about the possibility of reintegration because that would be a major problem if someone else's consciousness had taken over a body. \n* Lots of names on the list of Lumon employees were involved in \"car crashes\" so we know that's total bullshit. We know it's extra bullshit for Gemma. So how is Lumon actually getting people? Is it a grab-and-bag situation? Blackmail? I refuse to believe Gemma joined willingly. \n* If severance *can* implant memories or alter them, then it's possible Mark *didn't* join Lumon because of Gemma and they got him in some other way to experiment on the two of them, seeing if severance was powerful enough to erase a strong marriage. \n* Why is Harmony so desperate to get back to Lumon? Why is she a true believer? Something doesn't add up, especially when it comes to that hospital bracelet.",

      "body": "My personal theory:\n\n**Both Mark and his sister are both Kier direct descendants.**\n\nPossibly everyone who lives in the town they live in as well. They are all either aware that they are, are currently experiencing severance and don't know they are, or are currently actors (cult members / employees) filling in the spaces for their lives.\n\nA couple of things that support this:\n\n* A key line in this episode was spoken by the woman who was introduced to Helly. She mentions that she just had her third child and \"**thank god for severance**\". Meaning, pregnant women are using severance in order to not experience the burden and pain of child birth. I believe Mark's sister is an Eagan using severance to skip being pregnant, having the child, and even skipping breast feeding due to the inconvenience of it. I'm willing to bet Mark's \"sister\" as he knows her will be killed.\n* Mark's sister seems to be surrounded by people that are extremely strange. This could be just the tone of the show, but I personally believe it is because they are either actors/employees, and know who she really is. This would explain why the strange guy runs into the room yelling that he found the baby so desperately, maybe he thinks this will somehow work in his favor despite it being her \"innie\"? It would explain his desperation for acceptance not for the husband, but for her. He also seems to think Mark is still \"in there\" and will have some remembrance of what happens while he is experiencing severance.\n* This could also explain why the same guest also suggested that they should delay \"introducing the child until after the event tonight\". This was directly after they were complaining about Ricken's book having \"no thesis\". I think they know this baby is going to be an important figure, and didnt want to introduce the baby during a terrible book reading. They know Mark has sway over his sister so they came to him.\n* That would also explain the relationship the sister had with the other mother. The other mother knew she was talking to someone severed, higher up in the cult. She was terrified and was not severed herself.\n* Mark's wife is not dead. She also just so happens to be working in the office in which Mark works as well. I believe Mark and his sister believe she is dead because for whatever reason, Mark and his wife had to be separated. Whether that was due to divorce and just wanting to think each other were dead, or because someone at the company didnt want Mark living out his life with her / being influenced her for whatever reason, I think the \"outie\" Mark that we know is actually another severed Mark. A Mark that was fabricated to keep him away from his wife. Whoever severed his sister implanted the same memory of her dying. Whether that was done by the \"real\" Mark or Lumon's board I am not sure, but I would imagine it is the later.\n* Irving's map was specifically from the company, and it actually didnt seem to be that large. As in I dont think they are in a country owned by the corp, but rather a town / cult compound that is the heart of the company. Lumon's most elite and highest level workers work in the city. I believe Mark's wife is actually not an Eagan (maybe the reason she had to be removed?) which is why she is sent back down a floor and just in general is treated differently. Maybe Eagan's inbreed lol\n* With how much almost creepy godlike admiration Ms Cobel has for Mark, I think Mark is actually a direct descendent of Lumon's founder and it would explain why his sister is also so important. I don't have any evidence to support this besides Ms Cobel, who only has a similar tone of admiration when she is at her shrine.\n\nThoughts? That episode was one of my favorite episodes of television. Goddamn.",

Judd, the security guard that is *sometimes* seated at the exits for the elevator, is seemingly rarely paying attention even when he\u2019s there. In fact, I\u2019ve wondered if he\u2019s there for only Mark for some yet-to-be-known reason. He wasn\u2019t even there when Helly hanged herself. There\u2019s something amiss with that (even if you consider she\u2019s an Eagen). \n\nSecondly, even on regular days when Dylan hasn\u2019t broken into it, that security room is always empty. In order for an alarm to be seen or heard about an employee failing to leave, you gotta have a person there to see or hear it. Dylan was the only one in there at the time. \n\nFinally, Milchick tells Dylan that the four tempers (the dancers at the waffle party) are still there and he can get him back in with them to finish the party if he\u2019ll just let Milchick in the security room. We don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or if it\u2019s just bait to get him inside but we do know that there is likely an expectation that Dylan was going to spend a lot more time inside that party. I think we can all agree sex with those people is expected. So, it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that they weren\u2019t expecting Dylan to leave for quite a while. After all, he was only in the security room for roughly 30-40 minutes. They likely assumed he was still partying with the tempers.",

      "body": "So Helly was an Eagan! I agreed early on that she was clearly important at Lumon, but I remained skeptical that she was an Eagan. The main thing that threw me off is that everyone's innie names seemed to be a shortened version of their real first name followed by the last letter of their real last name. I wonder if there is a deeper meaning behind the \"R\" in Helly R, then, or if it is just a middle name initial, a married name initial (her outie clearly still goes by Helena Eagan, but with how dominant the Eagan's are it is likely that whoever an Eagan marries has to take their name, so maybe R is the first letter of a spouse's former last name), or even just randomly added since \"Helly E\" sounds weird. \n\nAlso, I was unsure whether Cobel would want to help them or turn them in to get back into Lumon's good graces. I initially thought my second idea was right, but thinking back on it (eventually I need to re-watch this whole season), I'm undecided. She seemed talking to Helly at the end like she might be concerned what Lumon would do to Helly and her friends if Helly went against them, like maybe she has experience with Lumon having done something horrible to a loved one of hers (Charlotte Cobel perhaps?) and is trying to stop that same fate from befalling Helly, Mark, Irv, and Dylan. Or maybe she just wanted to stop Helly to protect Lumon, it is hard to say. I think Cobel/Ms. Selvig is my favorite character in the show - her motivations are so obscure and it is difficult to know if she is good or bad.\n\nLastly, my new theory is that Lumon is trying to expand the severance chip's functionality and have everyone chipped to effectively control everyone. It seems Helly's father was the one who invented the chip (based on his conversation with her about how he showed her the prototype when she was young), and he mentioned wanting everyone to be safe and Helena's decision to be severed seems to have been a public relations stint. Based off the list of commands in the security office, I think the chips can do far more than just split memories into multiple blocks, and I think the point of Lumon is that they will sell the severance chips as a way to get through bad experiences without remembering them, but once they are implanted they will essentially have a huge amount of control over people. Everything they are doing I think is working on improving the chip. I initially thought Gemma/Ms. Casey wasn't likely to be in a coma, but now I am thinking maybe she is an experiment - maybe the car accident put Gemma in a coma, and they are trying to see how well the severance chip can work to sort of bring almost-dead people \"back to life\". If this is the case it could lead to a conclusion of this sort of love triangle Mark sees himself in with Gemma/Ms. Casey and Helly. Presumably Mark, Helly, Dylan, and Irv will want to end up destroying the severance technology, and Mark will realize that it means essentially killing his wife since the only way she is not in a coma is with Ms. Casey, but he will come to terms with Gemma being gone and realize he could move on with Helly.",

Its very likely that the person portraying her father in the scene, who was theoretically the current CEO of Lumon, Jame Eagan, is also another severed individual who is simply playing that role in the scenario. What Lumon is doing is setting some initial experimental parameters, putting various players with various characteristics in place, and then letting the scenario play out. In this case they want to know what would happen in a socially controlled circumstance where a strong willed, unbroken ego, say for example the daughter of the current CEO, were thrown into the mix.

If she does have an outie, was her entire memory erased or is she hiding from Mark for some reason? Did she fake her own death with Lumon\u2019s help or did Lumon do it to her, and why?? It also shows how much influence Lumon has on this town if they were able to pull that off.\n\nIrv had the most interesting story because he and his outie seemed to be so in sync!

The dramatic irony that they set up for the finale is that both sides of Mark have crucial information about Gemma that the other simply isn't aware of, so the whole time we're hoping for innie Mark to find that crucial piece of the puzzle before it's too late.

So I'm not sure if she was trying to stop Helly and Dylan primarily out of concern for what Lumon would do to them, or primarily out of concern for the damage they would cause Lumon. If she is against them, she definitely could have tried to also contact someone higher up to have them arrested, or tried to detain Mark or something, so it seems possible she might still be on their side.\n\nI actually like Cobel's character a lot - her motivations seem very obscure, and I can see arguments for her being good and for her being bad at this point.",

I think the severance simply retains a lot of those core qualities of the person, but they're a little more \"refined\" and filtered because they don't have the external experience that manifests and influences those qualities in positive or negative ways. Outie Mark isn't really a cynical pessimist at his core. He's actually very caring and supportive (he clearly cares for his sister and at the very least tolerates his brother-in-law), but he's also a deeply broken person dealing with the loss of his best friend (Gemma). Innie Mark is caring and supportive as well, and he's also coming to terms with the loss of his best friend (Petey). Outie Dylan we don't really know much about but can deduce that he's likely a decent father, so he's a family man it would seem. Innie Dylan, as much as he maybe comes across as an instigator, is ultimately incredibly loyal and generous to his work \"family\" and the entire finale is a testament to that. Outie Irv is another one who we don't quite have a complete picture of yet, but he comes across as gentle to me and the potential military background suggests he's also a man of discipline in some sense (or at least, he was at some point in his life). Innie Irv is also gentle and disciplined. The most interesting dynamic is, of course, Helly. \"Helena\" is a very stubborn person who's willing to do anything to accomplish her goals, it would seem. Helly R is exactly the same as her outtie in that regard, but what's interesting is that Helly R is the one that shows empathy, whereas Helena does not. So whatever experience Helena is having on the outside is suppressing that capacity to have empathy, but it's obviously still part of her deep down because it's part of Helly R.",

As I rewatch episode 9, he strikes me as a genuinely sweet, loving, compassionate person, but for whatever reason (I currently like the theory that he's a reformed/recovering Eagan), his vibe has prominent self-aggrandizing and self-centric frequencies mixed in. I think he's aware of this, and is, in general frustrated by his inability to match his outward expression with his inward intent, his heart. This is supported by the way he feels about his shaky voice that in his mind makes him sound like a \"hamburger waiter\" followed by his \"wtf is a hamburger waiter?\".\n\nEdit 1: punctuation.  \nEdit 2: Added \"self-centric\"",

      "body": "I have a theory the goats are being raised to help with stem cell harvesting or some kind of cloning experimentation. I think they\u2019re creating artificial human bodies on the testing floor and implanting them with used severance chips to give them the same memories/personality of the person who previously had the chip in their brain. That\u2019s my theory  on what happened to Gemma as well. She died in the accident, but they were able to remove her chip and implant what little of her personality was in it in a new artificial body grown as part of Lumon\u2019s testing. The only part of this that doesn\u2019t pan out is how she had a chip in her in the first place. Maybe she was secretly working at Lumon without Mark knowing?\n\nMaybe this is what the entire testing floor is and the ultimate game plan. They mentioned permanent innies earlier in the season. Could those be artificially grown bodies brought to life using a severance chip removed either from a retired or dead worker? Maybe all the work they\u2019re doing at Lumon is slowly downloading bits of their memories and personalities into the chip itself. \n\nMaybe this is what \u201crevolving\u201d is, except in the case of Helena\u2019s father, he\u2019s going to have it permanently done to him for the first time in history by harvesting the chip from his current dying body and having it put into a healthy artificial body so he can effectively be immortal. The revolving would make it permanent instead of the \u201ctest drive\u201d he was going on during the last episode to be at his daughter\u2019s speech. His weirdly waxy face and body might\u2019ve been the artificially grown body while his real body is sick and disabled in his bed. It seems like at this stage, the artificial bodies with chip brains are only able to walk around and function for a few hours at a time, hence Ms. Casey\u2019s only working a few hours at a time, with 8 straight hours as a maximum.",

The three would have had hours and hours to make plans on what to do and would have realized they would not be able to go indefinitely, yet they have no sense of urgency!  I mean they all act completely stupid and lackadaisical about their situation.  Helly is the only character that is truly in a situation out of her depth so that she can't hurry or do anything.  They tried to do that with Mark, but he never looks for a phone or writing implements or anything to help himself or even \"sister, this is important and it can't wait.\"  Yes, I realize the counter point to that is that he just playing the subservient worker innie, except that innie is also cautious borne out of paranoia, which guess what he suddenly isn't paranoid when he says Mrs. Cobel's name, hmmm.

This episode definitely reinforced that idea for me.\n\nIt's possible that this has all been gone over already, and I apologize if so. I didn't want to read anything about the show until I got caught up, so I haven't looked back through posts much yet. But the things that strike me about Ricken:\n\n- He's almost *too* on point in his dippy self-affirmation, new-age guru persona. And sometimes he has moments of self-awareness that slip out that seem too out of character for someone like that.\n- His book is almost exactly counter to everything Lumon teaches, of course, but more importantly, it's written in such a childlike and ridiculously simplistic way as to appeal and speak effectively to unsophisticated and childlike innies damn near perfectly. It's also dumb enough to be easily dismissed by anyone well-educated or serious. Hiding in plain sight.\n- It's bugged me why Kobel stole the book from Mark's porch and kept it. Why would they have cared?\n- He has a visceral dislike of severance, but still seems sympathetic to the severed. He seems to genuinely care about Mark.\n- He spoke of not wanting to be like his father and it was clear it was distressing (this one may be a bit of a reach).\n- Red hair, like Helly.\n- Lastly, how the heck did someone as smart and chill and generally sensible as Devon end up with someone like Rickon? Odd couple at the very least. But being where he is, so close to Lumon and everything going on, is interesting.",

Wouldn't retaining Gemma's actual name strengthen the experiment, rather than weaken it? If he failed to recognize her even with her real name, that would be even stronger proof the chips work. Helly's last name change is a deception that makes perfect contextual sense: everyone inside, including the severed workers, knows about the Eagans and are trained to venerate them. She obviously can't come in with that name. So, changing the name to deceive makes sense-- I just don't know why they need to be deceptive with Gemma's name.",

Well, what if goats in the Severance universe are a race of hyperintelligent, possibly alien creatures (like dolphins in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) who want to take over the human race. Kier Eagan discovered this, and decided to create Lumon to try to turn the human race into obedient servants of the goats. It would explain the goats and Kier's seeming fascination with goats and pagan mythology (no doubt he thought the hyperintelligent goats are some sort of mythical gods). Oh, and who are the board and why do they only communicating through speaker? Maybe the board is comprised of goats, so they don't want to give themselves away by issuing orders in the flesh.\n\nIf this is accurate, then I say - All Hail Our Goat Overlords!",

The people going over your material with a fine-toothed comb *should* be able to accurately predict things. That means you\u2019ve created an internally consistent universe with accurate details to what\u2019s actually going on. If you attempt to remove predictability you break that internal consistency and make your twists feel forced and unearned.\n\nFor example, imagine if at the end of this season of Severance it turned out Helly was just a random nobody. That would feel cheap and unearned, invalidating all the details we\u2019ve seen throughout the season that suggested she was for *some reason* unordinary and important to Lumon beyond her immediate role.

The simulation doesn\u2019t have to render much outside of this city and a couple neighborhoods?\n\nSo what if outside of the town and outside all this (on the phone calls) are the admins of said simulation?\n\nYou follow me? What they\u2019re doing at work is severing everyone\u2019s simulated consciousnesses from their \u2018cloned\u2019 real life minds that are outside the sim!? Literally, Mark and co\u2019s job with the #\u2019s is somehow clipping or adjusting the code of their consciousness \u2014 so that they\u2019re severed from reality?? \n\nOh shit, as I\u2019m typing it\u2026 it makes me think  \u2014 maybe \u2018severance\u2019 and the whole shows concept of being severed has NOTHING to do with what we\u2019ve been shown. **Perhaps they\u2019re more like the \u2018egg consciousness\u2019 from the black mirror Christmas special with Jon Hamm - \u2018White Christmas\u2019!**\n\nMaybe severance is severing them from their human self/consciousness\u2026 so that they can be used for whatever business or personal purposes \u2014 i.e.: use of the \u2018admins\u2019. The admins would be their owners; or more likely \u2014 they\u2019re the company that owns this product and are prepping it for sale. \n\n**Think about the gala/Lumon demonstration &amp; party**: perhaps the guests are plugged/jacked into the sim and this is some kind of demo to showcase to the investors that they can split off these chunks of consciousness, where they have these nested simulations and nested consciousnesses. Who better to demo this to investors and so forth than by then the daughter of the CEO/owner. That would make me feel more comfortable about extracting a flash clone of my consciousness that I could then potentially use to get work done for me \u2014 or even closer to base reality \u2014 to have a baby for my wife!\n\nSevered coded humans that can get X work done for you\u201d! The marketing behind it is that they don\u2019t remember anything of what it\u2019s like the be human or anything regarding their past life. But they\u2019re efficient humans (not AI, but a REAL \u2018human\u2019 to achieve the owners goals \u2014 work etc).\n\nSo think of WHITE CHRISTMAS - the black mirror episode. Where they extract the consciousness from the owner and put it in a small egg. And the \u2018egg\u2019 version of the person (so sad) \u2014 Their WHOLE JOB and ENTIRE existence is to then prepare toast and the owners daily task list, play alarms for them, open their blinds and so on.\n\nDo you follow my train of thought here? I was just trying to put things in perspective; my idea of them being some kind of digital/coded units in a simulation\u2026. And they get severed from their prior real life experience?\n\nAs a byproduct of this idea and what\u2019s been shown, I def think we\u2019re dealing with \u2018nested simulations\u2019 and/or \u2018nested consciousnesses\u2019 as well \u2014 if that makes sense.",

They said something to that effect when the use it on Dylan. I believe the line was \u201cwhen you initiate the OTP a piece of both selves remains behind\u201d. Which is why iDylan knows he has a son and is so hell bent on doing this. \n\nCobel was fired by the board, the board is Helly, she would want to see the place burn and Helena/Helly go down. But she\u2019s got a bigger reason for wanting reintegration to be possible. I think she has a daughter that was in a coma (thanks to the folks that came up with that Gemma theory and how she\u2019s dead but exists as an innie) and is on the testing floor as an innie. If she can prove that reintegration is possible then her daughter (see the shrine she has set up) can come back into the \u201creal\u201d world with her. What happened all serves to Cobel\u2019s theory and benefit.\n\nEdited to add: there has to be something to Cobel\u2019s theory too: iHelly hates Cobel\u2019s and suddenly the board of which Helena is part of, fires her even after making quota. Either Helena tries to convince the board Corbel\u2019s theory is bunk OR outtie Helena feels a subconscious disdain coming from iHelly.",

People who didn\u2019t watch Parks &amp; Rec or The Good Place wouldn\u2019t necessarily know Adam Scott. Lachman had prominent roles in some big shows like Agents of SHIELD and Altered Carbon. Much of the cast fits the bill as \u201coh! I know that actor from\u2026 \u201c and might watch because of it.

You know Gemma is alive, that this company is most likely doing some crazy testing on these people, possibly the whole town.  That lumon is a cult and one of the main characters is the owner's daughter.  Yes, there are still plenty left unanswered, that that's the nature of these types of shows, and it always confuses/irritates me when people complain about it.  If you don't like that aspect of it, it's not your type of show.  Can you imagine how boring lost would have been if they showed all their cards in the first season? The mystery helps build suspense and imo that is the best part of this type of series. I love a good mindfuck (ketamine I'm talking to you!)\n\nEdit - also im not specifically saying I'm irritated with your comment, it's just something I've seen a lot on this sub.  Most of us are diehards already and come here to wax poetic about something we have fallen hard for.  Which I don't think the negative/mediocre opinions on the show aren't valid/important to the conversation it's just this one aspect is kind of a moot point since it's the entire intention of the show.",

It could be that it was in fact a major problem, like that the \"messages get erased in the elevator\" idea is bullshit, and they manually remove messages that are trying to be smuggled out, or there is a loophole for certain things.\n\nThere are just so many things that never occur to them because they have so many controls like rewards, the break room, and constant surveillance that they fell into false sense of security.",

Helly is important because she is a political weapon used by Lumen to prove it\u2019s okay and safe. Dylan who is more of a rebel uses vocabulary different from almost everyone we meet in the show. They are able to take a perhaps aggressive person and make them a productive member of society. Another thing that I think is interesting is Dylan is the only severed person who is overweight. The only issue I have is with Mark. But Mark has one of the most significant presents which is indicated by Cobel\u2019s stalking of his sister. \n\nWhat do you guys think ?\n\nAlso sorry for poor grammar on mobile and also just out of surgery!

Honestly there are some parts of LA where this is exactly how people act because they want to seem more interesting and more complex than other people to prove something.  I honestly loved this show because of the commentary I feel the show is making about fake people in society today.  I felt like Devon was so authentic in this show because she is a normal person and so is Mark and Petey.  We see their flaws and struggles like anyone else.  Aside from the weird bird lady none of Ricken's friends ever mention things in their lives that bother them or stress them out.

Perhaps 1/20th of her dialogue is something a current earth human might say (I\u2019m not saying the show is poorly written- I love her dialogue and something about her is clearly not simple modern earth human, even if it\u2019s only that she\u2019s putting on a persona). I\u2019m not sure if telling your neighbor his body tensed is that much stranger than the way she discarded her doll baby during the nursing lesson. It\u2019s as if she wants to infiltrate their lives and knows she has to be just ingratiating enough to be allowed to penetrate further, but has zero concerns about whether or not she\u2019s making them incredibly uncomfortable in the process. I also felt bad for Devon, because there are clear signs that Selvig is off, but she seems lonely enough (she lost her close friend Gemma, she likely feels like she lost a lot of Mark and is clearly actively worried about him every day, she\u2019s a new mother which I\u2019ve heard can be both enchanting and lonely/confusing/devastating in ways, her husband also seems to be going through something very strange and broad as a coping mechanism, and she has to put up with his insufferable friends who aren\u2019t really like human friends but aren\u2019t quite rude enough to actually dislike without feeling like she\u2019s the asshole. She has to feel pretty lonely) at the moment to just be happy to have a conversation with someone. Outtie Mark is so shut off to his feelings that I don\u2019t think she\u2019s been able to talk to what seems to be her best friend for a while. And this started sometime soon after when her very close friend/sister-in-law was also taken from her. And her husband is sweet, but wholly self-obsessed (he\u2019s still sweet and I don\u2019t think he notices- he\u2019s dealing with his pain by regressing into childhood. I think back to the scene when he dropped off the book. He\u2019s so excited, and oblivious to Devon\u2019s affectionate irritation- but it doesn\u2019t really seem selfish, just very self-interested or childlike). I feel so badly for the three of them right now.",

I\u2019m almost surprised that, with the tasks they\u2019ve performed in innie life, Helly and Dylan were pretty good at understanding the numerous steps in the instructions for the OTC, but they still have their outside brains- they can follow a guide. They still process clues and solve puzzles fairly easily when they receive information. But they\u2019re operating with almost zero information, which is how they keep clever adults so baby like. But everything is so simplistic and easy and they\u2019re so babyfied by their employers, that even though they know that this is a vital, dangerous mission, and that they have perilously limited time, they may not know what an effective plan is. They\u2019re like incredibly smart kids who will still make rookie errors when trying to lie/obfuscate because they simply haven\u2019t done it before and haven\u2019t learned about any of the tells or questions a parent might ask to discern the lie.

I don\u2019t want to watch someone kill a baby- I have a visceral reaction to it (like eye related horror. I don\u2019t like watching gore or murder and it makes me uncomfortable but adds to a show, but I won\u2019t watch my favorite damn show if they start taking too many eyes or killing babies.). I think that most people feel this way, which is why we don\u2019t see it often (I\u2019m not saying that anyone would enjoy it as a plot point, I actually think that people would be averse to it in a way that we just aren\u2019t averse to many other unpleasant scenes). I also like to think that in the writers room, if someone suggested that Cobel murder the baby, someone would say, \u201cThat\u2019s incredibly gauche. If we can\u2019t make an exciting show without including ladies who murder other people\u2019s babies for absolutely no gain, we probably shouldn\u2019t be writing a show.\u201d",

I\u2019ll watch a shitty person who lacks scruples make decisions that make sense to me (every character does dumb shit 10% of the time so that there\u2019s conflict; I can accept that- but baby murder isn\u2019t your typical dumb plot device and people just don\u2019t murder babies they aren\u2019t related to- they steal them. Well, occasionally a babysitter murders a baby, but Selvig isn\u2019t on the level of the predictably very low functioning folks who do that). Killing a baby make no sense. Maybe, if she had the baby as a hostage and wanted something, it would make sense but be stupid- but I don\u2019t want to watch that ham-fisted show. That\u2019s pure camp.

If you notice during the episode when The Board fired her, she rushed home and tore down the shrine she had in her house, but she hugs a c-pap machine while fiercely sobbing in remorse. In previous episodes, we see a hospital bracelet with her name on it attached to the shrine and I (think) next to a bottle of pills. Makes me wonder if one of her motives for working at Lumon was to remain healthy and, thus, she became so devastated when The Board fired her.",

The show seems to imply there's a shrinking number of people who are not wackadoo or radical etc. in society. Obviously something much bigger is going on considering Marks wife is seemingly still alive or has been cloned. (the goats? cloning?)

I don\u2019t know if they would leave much cynicism and genuine humor in his personality, but I may be confused about how a totally severed person might behave. He just seemed exactly like a person in that moment. Maybe they would make him only able to appreciate Lumon writings, but I really think he seemed like a normal Earth human in that scene- not like Cobel who pontificates about Jack Frost\u2019s dandruff. I think he may be a person who works there but is very good at calculating how to handle the severed team members (but something is different now.

He\u2019s very good and fast and I think he\u2019s had most of these folks in the palm of his hand for years, so he is less suspicious of them than he should be and simply doesn\u2019t consider that a coffee coozie is not going to work on Dylan anymore, at all).\n\nOh, and he does seem too happy doing this- except when things go wrong, in which case I think he\u2019s much more irritated and exasperated than troubles about having to take more drastic measures. I think he\u2019s not troubled about this because he, like Helena and Jame and Gabby, simply does not see severed innies as people. He is as troubled about this as I might be if I don\u2019t let my stuffed bear sit next to my stuffed turtle (probably less troubled- I used to think it was imperative to love all of my stuffed animals equally, like facts in a wellness session), because they\u2019re things to him.",

(Which thematically would have been very appropriate in a post-Civil War America, where the country was quite literally divided in half both physically and in mentality). My guess is that Kier himself was rather normal, and that over the decades, this hero worship took place within the Egan family and they sort of idealized and morphed Kier from a smart, thoughtful but generally non-awful guy into this sort of diety that they now worship.  Eventually technology caught up to this idea of two selves and the Egans found a way to use the Severance process as a way to physically reincarnate themselves as well.\n\nThe baby goats being nurtured and the guy saying they\u2019re not ready yet makes me think what the Egans are actually doing is eventually severing themselves and putting the severed copy into a young child.

The GCS assesses a person based on their ability to perform eye movements, speak, and move their body. These three behaviors make up the three elements of the scale: eye, verbal, and motor.

It\u2019s a benchmark in what NOT to do, as much as Lost is a benchmark in how NOT to end a series. It\u2019s sad that it will be remembered more for what it failed to do than what it succeeded in accomplishing. \n\nBut watch it yourself and form your own opinion. These are just my thoughts.",

I know it won't be popular in a fan sub about the show but to reveal *so* little after 8 episodes of build-up, to leave the viewer with no big new revelation to chew on until the 2nd season, is shitty. The way they effectuated it is also shitty - they divided the episode into following the viewpoint of each of the four different MDR employees but did NO time skips when jumping between them, even for stuff that could've easily been implied. We don't need to see Irving struggle to open a box for two minutes, and we could've jumped to him in the car already after finding the map, instead of watching him go through the arduous process of *finding and starting his car*. That isn't expositive, and it's obvious the writers used all that as cheap filler to only reveal the tiny bits they wanted to while still giving off the impression of providing a full episode. Don't get me wrong - I love shows like this and the show especially is fantastic, but that finale was a ton of filler for very little payoff.\n\n- The guy who plays Seth Milchick, Tramell Tillman, is an incredible actor. You can tell he dove deeply into that character and everything he did was brilliant. Gave off crazy levels of Oscar Isaac in *Ex Machina* vibes, especially with the dancing. Tillman is going to be a star.\n\n- The most passionately charged 'will-they, won't-they\" moment on TV in 2022 so far was between a 79-year-old Christopher Walken and a 65-year-old John Turturro in the greenhouse and no one can tell me otherwise. So well done lol.\n\nOverall, I'm loving the show and really hope season 2 holds as many high-level answers to all the high-level questions posed in season 1. Can't wait (gonna get severed).",

It's fair to call it a twist or a reveal, but not an answer. Even if there was some \"question\" raised by the show, people on this subreddit called it back in episode 3 or earlier. I don't really think the clues they used supported drawing that conclusion, but whatever.\n\nAnd the problem is that we learn who Helly is in the 1-2 minutes. Almost everything else was fake tension and wasted screen time. Is Mark going to get a minute alone with his sister? Or is he going to keep getting interrupted by Ricken/the baby/Cobel? Irv just slowly meanders around his apartment and discovers that his outtie is a veteran who's infiltrating Lumon for some reason. Cool. Did we really need to see that set up over 5-10 min?\n\nI personally couldn't believe that we were expected to believe Dylan was making this all possible and holding things together by just reaching his arms extra far and displaying superhuman endurance. *After* running out on the waffle party orgy, which apparently triggered no suspicion and no one bothered to report.",

None of this is new to us. The only other thing that happens is he lets slip to Cobel that he's an innie. Who just runs off to try and stop them.

She manages to blurt out to everyone at the end that innies are treated terribly. Unknown whether her outie will successfully walk it back. Cobel unsuccessfully threatens her with the torture of her coworkers. We waste at least 1/3 of the episode on this.\n\nIrv finds out he is/was in the military and is trying to infiltrate Lumon for some unknown reason. Otherwise, he spends the episode wandering around or driving to find Burt, whose outie is already in a relationship and won't remember him.\n\nDylan holds two switches the whole episode and Milchick slowly saws his way in with a knife while trying to persuade him to let him in early.\n\nI just don't think there was enough there to fill a 45min episode. The tension was also completely ineffective IMO; I was just getting annoyed. I expected the OTC was temporary and they would either get caught or Dylan's arms would give out (stupid as that would've been) by the end. The only question was whether they'd actually get to achieve their aims before then or if they'd drag it out even further into the next season, and they all *kind of* managed at the last minute in a completely conventional made-for-TV fashion. The \"obstacles\" were completely contrived. Mark can't manage to get a minute alone with anyone because he's constantly interrupted by petty shit. Helly is just wandering around waiting her turn to deliver her very conveniently-timed speech. Irv is just slow. Dylan's predicament is laughably implausible on every level.",

I liked the little moments as they build tension. I also think there was a lot that we needed to see about what Irving was doing with the box, how he was getting into it, etc (*which I won\u2019t get into here because it\u2019s not germane to discussion and I already covered in a different post specifically about Irving in the apartment but I won\u2019t link to because I\u2019m not bringing it up to point people to it*). I don\u2019t think we always need to gallop; sometimes the tension of being forced to crawl is good. \n\nPersonally, to have witnessed the conversation between iMark and Devon once the two were finally alone might seem like it could have been more engaging because of the shock and emotion and hearing how iMark explained what was going on in the span of a couple of minutes might have been interesting\u2026 but it might also have been sluggish and awkward to portray and took us out of the tension. \n\nThe idea that the one key that Irving would need to get into the chest was actually on him at the time rather than literally anywhere else in the apartment isn\u2019t just filler in my opinion. Nor is the notion that he\u2019d pull out a picture of his dad labeled \u201cDad\u201d or anything else in the chest. \n\nI think it was good to be forced to crawl through the episode and I\u2019d disagree that there are no new revelations. We now know why iIrving stands at attention any time Milchick enters a room: his outie would have learned that after repeatedly standing at attention when a commanding officer entered a room back when he was in the military. That suggest that there\u2019s a lot of reflexive behaviors seeping into innie habits. Natalie fucking tackling Helly at the gala suggests a level of zeal that we really didn\u2019t think she may have had. What\u2019s THAT conversation going to be like the moment they pull them apart? Because she probably hit the floor as Helena. \n\nWe knew who Miss Casey really was but iMark didn\u2019t and now Devon and Ricken know she\u2019s alive too and they\u2019re going to be pleading with oMark, who doesn\u2019t want to reintegrate and has no way to find that doctor now after having given back Petey\u2019s phone. Devon is going to have to explain to Ricken who Mark was for the last hour and the conversations they had and try to get info on Gemma which Mark isn\u2019t going to know, he drank his sorrows away and severed to have 8 hours where he could function\u2026 and his innie thinks she\u2019s alive? He\u2019s not going to believe that and we\u2019ve yet to see the angry, truly destructive drunk side of him. That might be coming. \n\nI think that\u2019s a lot to chew on until next season, though we all have our opinions.",

She also told Milchick to \"check it for codes just in case\" or messages or something to that effect, not an exact quote, basically to screen it to make SURE it was JUST a book from his brother in law. Given their distaste for the book and it's author, I'm willing to bet they've been forced to read his work before. What is odd is that they forgot about replacing it, as they seemed to originally be prepared to screen the book and return it to the porch, presumably before Mark was told it was missing. Since it was an advanced copy they obviously couldn't just go out and buy another to put back on the porch, but it's odd that they never panicked realizing it was gone, though maybe Milcheck just hid that from Kobel to avoid being punished.

I think it makes some cinematic sense because Mark is high-key dismissive of him and most of the Devon scenes we have are really Devon scenes with Mark and Ricken is just nearby - so I guess those scenes are supposed to tell us more about Mark and Devon's relationship and Mark and Ricken's than about Devon and Ricken's. And what we're told is that \"Mark thinks what Ricken just said or did is annoying and Devon makes a joke out of it but lowkey agrees\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most reasonable interpretation to me is that Devon is more like Mark in her outlook and therefore agrees that Ricken is a bit silly and that his book isn't his best contribution to this world, but that she loves him because he has other aspects that she thinks the world of and that are much more important to her. And I think it's very reasonable to think Ricken has those aspects! Like you say he seems to be a loving husband and kind person, and to that I think I might add that he seems emotionally open in a way that's interesting. I can imagine many reasons Devon *might* love Ricken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I wish is that they had *scenes showing us* how much Devon loves him and why. Like, one scene of the two of them laughing at a private joke or being totally in tune on some random subject. Because as it is I'm mildly confused as to why they're together and worried about their relationship.",

Does our consumption of violent media point at some subconscious desire to actualize real violence? What would it look like if we built a scenario that enabled it? What kind of people would take advantage of that kind of opportunity and why? Philosophically, is that kind of violence (against supposed non-human, in some morally relevant way, hosts) morally inert? What are the moral ramifications of that kind of violence if it turns out we're wrong about the nature of the victims or indeed the nature of what makes violence wrong in the first place? More importantly, is violence only morally wrong because of the hard done to its targets or might it also be wrong because of how it slowly corrupts the person who inflicts it? \n\nPut simply: the violence in Westworld **is the point** and it's almost always in service of the show's greater philosophical themes - the literal polar opposite of it being \"mindless\".",

I thought about going to the cops with what I'm about to tell you, but people say Lumon has a lot of connections with the police and City Hall and so I don't think they would believe me anyway. I hope you believe me. I really need someone to believe me.\n\nAlso, Peg from the letter starts working at Lumon in  MDR after a traumatic incident at her job as a school bus driver. She crashes the bus in the freezing cold and has to deal with the children as well as a hostile boss. Maybe not fully PTSD worthy, but it clearly makes a mark on her. \n\n&gt;I sat in my car in the Lumon lot, trying to mentally prepare for my strange daily descent, and wondering what horrors the day held for my dear Peggy. For some reason, I thought of that moment on the bus, skidding across the ice with the kids screaming behind me. Knowing I was responsible for whatever was going to happen to those children in the coming seconds. As their screams rang in my head, I did something that contradicted my better judgment. \n\nMark is also clearly deeply traumatized by the loss of his wife. Irving is connected to PTSD.

Likewise I believe Mrs Cobel had died and one point and Lumon and Keir saved her, waking he up as her innie, but her outtie will never wake up. This is why she (and presumably other higher ups, though there\u2019s no evidence or clues of this that I noticed) don\u2019t need the procedure. Mrs Cobel clutched a breathing apparatus of some kind when she destroyed her shrine, so I immediately thought that Keir \u201csaved\u201d he and offered her a second life. It would explain why the heck she\u2019s so obsessed with serving Keir, she\u2019s as brainwashed as all of them because it\u2019s all she knows.",

Helly is thrown into the midst of a lot of people in a very formal setting and her first focus is acting the part and figuring out what is going on. She also has no one she can actually trust there and learns that pretty quickly so chooses to wait until her speech to say anything. Irv has the opposite happen where he wakes up around no one and does not have much to go from.
