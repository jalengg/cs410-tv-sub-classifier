The only thing I wasn't *too* huge a fan of was the convenience of Mark choosing to follow a random ambulance and happening to see Petey.\n\nSomething I noticed, to me it felt like there was a shift in Milchick's attitude at the end of the breaking room session with Helly, directly after he glances at Harmony. It's either that he's actually exasperated by Helly's attitude or he doesn't really want to be a part of this. Which makes me wonder if he could be a potential ally for Mark and co, or if he had some part in helping Petey? The break room has a recording device, so maybe he helped record Petey's smuggled tape?\n\nAnother interesting note, it was also shown that every CEO (at least of the name plaques we see) died while in office except for Gerhardt Eagan (the first woman CEO) who lived from 1920-1991 and was in office 1976-1987.\n\nAlso, the camera heavily lingers on the TV when Mark is hiding everything in his basement, is that meant to imply he's being filmed or something?",

I believe that the project isn't just about severance, but making workers believe what Lumen wants them to. The news and Marks Sister know about severance, but I believe these are just more tests to see if they can create entire scenarios in the workers minds. \n\nThe numbers are just numbers, but they're part of a long term project to see if they can make the innies feel emotions by using complex combinations of numbers so they can use that to make them more productive workers, as well as help with Lumen testing the implants of thoughts.  \n\nThis is why Harmony lives next door and seems obsessed with Mark. She's making sure the procedure is taking and going well. I'm sure there's people following the other members of the crew, and they might even have known about Petey but wanted to see The downsides of the procedure being reversed.\n\nMain questions so far: \n\n1.Who's the mole? Someone must have given Petey the tape with Mark in the break room and gotten Petey out. Who did it?\n\n2. What's going on with the board? Why do they not speak and just listen?",

It\u2019s not the same thing. \nAnd then marks sister says mark and his dad used to have \u201cwhisky is life\u201d carved on a flask. \nMeaning something consumed that is enjoyable. \n\nI\u2019m getting the impression that food is no longer NECESSARY.

I'm not sure what to make of that possibility yet. Because on the one hand, you have the board who seems to think severance is irreversible. But on the other, everyone on the MDR team is relatively new. Nobody's been there 5, 10, 20+ years. Is that because severance doesn't last very long before ... something happens? \n\nHow long has severance been a thing? Long enough for there to be protest groups and news debates. But is that just a few years? Or decades? Why are there no real old timers on the team? We only know about Petey and Carol D. How long were they there? How many other people have been on the team as severed employees, and what eventually happened to them?\n\nLots of interesting questions, and I love it.",

Could they be close on the outside? They obviously know each other from the way they act together on the outside- and Milchick presents her with flowers after her first day. That's also weird given the apparent prohibition on innies knowing each other outside (although Milchick himself isn't severed). The part where Milchick tells her she's doing an amazing thing just before Helly has the device implanted- could that thing be going 'undercover'? \n\n- What's the deal with the break room? Why doesn't Helly just refuse to go along? She's not threatened or even told she can't leave until she reads the statement. What wodve happened had she refused? Also interested that's it's called a 'compunction statement'- a feeling of anxiety arising from awareness of guilt.\n\n- Based on the above they 'pass' the break room statement when the monitors register sufficient anxiety, right? Made me think about the numbers eliciting fear, the wellness session, the Eagan screed about balancing four temperaments and...am I right in thinking they sort the numbers into four different baskets? \n\n-Anyone get shots of Petey's various maps? The one on the back of the photo had a black box with 'mind' written across it and what looked like it might be the black goo from Irv's dream dripping out of it.",

Although in this case we do know that her outie must have gotten the message that she at least initially didn't like it by the way she kept running through the door.\n\nThe fact that resigning is suicide for the self that lives at work made me initially think that one answer could just be actual suicide.  Upon further consideration, though, that's pretty harsh for the outie.  But it gives me an idea.  You could inflict steadily more severe cuts to your neck, which is a way to send a message to your outie that is both a cry for help and a kind of threat.\n\nWasn't it *Legion* that had a similar deal with one person speaking for a shadowy group on the other side of an intercom?

Rinse and repeat and you end up with a sort of algorithm for developing the best balance of these tempers. When it is time for a new Eagan to become CEO they take on the persona that is created from this experiment.\n\nThis seems implausible at first because lumon has been around since 1866 and only recently developed the severance procedure. I actually think this helps the theory. The current ceo is the most acclaimed. I think this is because the pervious Eegan\u2019s did not approach this quest for balancing the tempers in a rigorous enough manner. \n\nPrevious Eagan\u2019s could not literally create new personalities. They ran rough workplace experiments where people fit the tempers in a general sense but not to the level that lumon now can. These previous eagans would have used this coarse data to try to work on cultivating more balanced tempers.

With that said, the CEO theory makes sense, but I\u2019m not fully sold on it. \n\nTo respond to your comment though: \n\nFirst, I don\u2019t know if Marks reaction signaled that he recognized her or not, TBH. I feel like there\u2019s some leeway here, because even if he did recognize her, there\u2019s not much suggesting that his reaction would have been different. \n\nSecond, Mark has shown us that he doesn\u2019t really pay attention to the world around him, especially when it comes to the issue of severance/Lumen. Also, the fact that he resulted to childish debate techniques when discussing it with the whole mind collective guy (\u201chow old are you? are you even in high school?!\u201d, etc) and the lack of response he had at the dinner party when they asked basic questions, suggests that he hasn\u2019t thought very deeply about this issue at all. \n\nThird, if the theory is that she\u2019s a *future* CEO, there\u2019s a lot of reason to suggest that he wouldn\u2019t have a clue who she was.",

      "body": "I just watched the first 3 eps last night and haven't stopped thinking about it all! I agree with lots of theories people are sharing here, so I don't want to repeat my thoughts that have already been said. But I do have another theory that I haven't seen talked about (yet) so figured I'd throw it out there-\n\nI think Harmony is definitely severed as well. I don't think there is any proof of her being an unsevered worker. There is the one scene in her house when she's wearing braids and her disposition is distinctly different. She is watching Mark, but in a very different sad and concerned way. When we first learn of her through Mark's phone conversations, the fumbling woman who screws up her trash bins does not align with the woman who creepily melts ice on her front steps while fully dressed to monitor Mark. I don't think the bins are a planned surveillance sabotage of Mark's psyche. I really think it is a struggle of Harmony's outie's life.\n\nI think this theory is supported by other theories of multiple elevators that do not ding the implant chips when they first \"check in\" to work, and then can go back up a different route. I think her work hours must vary dramatically from Mark's. Her hours are much, much longer. Severed workers like her (and possibly also Milchik) can effectively be innies outside in the town. \nThis theory is also supported by the blue and red theme. Harmony is hecking up her bins of the two colors. \n\nWhat's unusual is she did not even notice the red envelope right on Mark's kitchen table as they sat there. I think this scene was her outie. She snoops on him because her outie is low key fixated on Mark's life. Innie Harmony noticed and confiscated the brown book package, but then handed it to Milchik for him to open. Can \"securely\" severed workers not see or not interact with red outside items? Hmm. I saw someone else theorize that Harmony could be Mark's mother in law, which would also explain her going right into his deceased wife's crafts, but I'm not super convinced yet. More importantly, the candle was also split colors. If his wife had that candle, she must have also been involved in some way. \n\nUnrelated, but what I can't explain in this story- why is Mark's sister presented as such a reasonable lady who is considerate of Mark, but her husband is such an absolute dingus of a human. How is that marriage compatible in a way that doesn't jump out at the viewer! Rickon and their friends are so bizarre that it's hard to see how it isn't intentional for some internal part of the story. Their personalities are very dramatic. Might have something to do with these four facets of souls. \n\nOne other thing that strikes me as weird- we see Natalie on the TV debating in favor of the right to choose Severance. She uses the term \"workie\" rather than \"innie.\" Innie and outie are openly discussed terms between the innies we meet. Why would she use the wrong term on tv? Who would that benefit? Does Natalie also have an outie who does not fully understand what she is trying to advocate for? \n\nEdited to add another thought: Petey as we see him remains an innie still. He escaped through the different elevator and his outie has never been re-activated. This explains why he can only search for Mark to connect with, and hides out in the greenhouse when he says he has a daughter. I beleive his innie was told small details of his outie during Wellness, which may or may not even be true tbh, but he cannot functionally use this information on the outside. \n\nSuper interested to see what anyone else thinks about these thoughts ;) and now I'll be anticipating each Friday, lol!",

Or, maybe Lumon is developing something like an \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" product, where they're killing painful memories for people. Maybe they're working on their own minds and the company is using that to inform their product for the masses?\n\nI also think the theory that the workers are the product test subjects is interesting, but I don't think that's right since the corporation genuinely cares about the output of their work - the work they do is highly valuable to the company.\n\nSeparately, I noticed water is a subtle theme. Mark and his date have full glasses of water at the restaurant. Mark and his sister go to that dinner party that's an odd water drinking party. Mark's coworker's theory about what the data points are is that it's the sea.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if its significant but we don't really know what the time period is.

They sign up for severance, and from then on everything is based on how they *feel*, both inside and outside the facility. The innies are working for 8hrs to isolate trauma memories, e.g. \"scary numbers\", and bin them. The innies are put through an emotional rehabilitation, something of a 'hot and cold therapy for the mind'. They have the wellness center for positive, they have the perpetuity wing for purpose, they have the break room for punishment and remorse, etc.\n\nIn the real world, Mrs. Selveg(sp) is gradually trying to remove memories of Mark's wife. When she was snooping in the basement she opened his memory box that we know is painful for him, and she took out a single item. She is also very concerned all the time about how Mark is feeling on the outside. It's because she's monitoring his progress and trying to manipulate him from both the inside and outside of the facility.",

I wonder if her outie is an activist who wants to expose what Lumon is up to and bring them down, and is hoping that her innie retains enough of her essential will to pull it off.",

It was the disturbing I had ever seen, still to this day, to watch a video of someone being killed in such a brutal way, and it just stuck with me when I heard the interview about how these people were treaded before hand. \n\nBack then we kinda just took officials at face value when they spoke about serious issues so it never occured to me to try and \"fact check\" it back then, It just seemed true because I remember that man reading his \"confession\" in such a calm way, with the blade to his neck. Originally I just thought he was so broken from torture that he didnt care anymore, but when I heard the interview describe how the victims were put through these rehearsals over and over, it kinda made sense to me why the person wasnt crying, shaking, pissing their pants moments before the final act. They assumed that it would be just like every time before, when nothing happened. \n\nIt could be Fake news or whatever but the statements just logically made sense with what I had seen. I wish I had never seen it, I wish I could remove that memory from my brain, but the video had such an impact on me, that the following info I got from the interview just stuck with me.",
