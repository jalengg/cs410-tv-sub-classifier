hxi652o,2,alisonrose1992,"With the boss/white haired lady living next to Mark, Petey's is definitely not surviving this season. Hope they show how he got himself unsevered and escaped.",197,1645222753,26
hxib7sa,2,ajhackerman,I recon she’s putting it on and is simply keeping tabs on Mark,27,1645224844,13
hxibfwe,2,alwaysbeclosing777,"I may just be overthinking it, but I feel like the multiple references to hell have some meaning. Episode 1 title, Helly’s name, on the wall of her party it says “hello Helly”… might just be a metaphor for hell, or more?",165,1645224939,42

The “outie” version of her said her mom is a Catholic and is super forgetful (the garbage bins). If she was severed, she would still have that dementia but she clearly doesn’t. She also told Mark she works at a shop, which is a lie. She also gives him weird looks and came to his house uninvited. She’s definitely keeping tabs on him.",279,1645225092,82
hxik3bc,2,LumonIndustries,Hooked on the concept since seeing a commercial a week ago. Just watched the first 2 episodes and safe to say I'm not disappointed. First half of Ep 1 was a little slow but that might be because I'd already watched every trailer and read every article about the show I could find so I already knew what was going on - might be more impactful going in blind. Anyway everything from the dinner party in Ep 1 onwards has been incredible. Tension building scene by scene and the concept is full of potential. Cant wait for next weeks ep,107,1645228706,100
hxj1c1c,2,OhSassafrass,Went into it blind. Now I’m here trying to make sense of any of it. Is his neighbor/boss severed too? How did Carol D leave but Petey escaped? Why is Irv ‘s mind literally melting?  How much do they pay people to be severed? What’s the symbolism of Helly wearing alternating shades of blue?,3,1645236876,54
hxj60m2,2,LumonIndustries,"A lot is still unknown of course as a big part of the intrigue is the shows mystery but I will give you my theories

\- IMO the boss is NOT severed but is in fact monitoring the ""outie"" version of the Mark. I believe this due to her facial expressions but also the fact that she gives Mark conflicting stories about her mothers religiosity depending on which version she is talking to

\- I'm starting to think the ""employees"" are pre-selected on the outside and brought to Lumon for some significant reason we are yet to see. This could mean that some ""employees"" are more important than others and even that some are only needed for a short while such as Carol D whilst others they intend to keep forever. This is just a theory ofc

\- I got the impression that Irvs episode was caused by him nearly falling asleep. They seem to be very strict about nobody sleeping on the job. Could just be because they want them to be as productive as possible when sorting the numbers or it could be to do with the chip not working if you sleep at work

\-I'm very interested in their pay also. There is reference to Irv getting wages docked because of him nodding off but how would they explain that to his Outie? Also in cases such as Marks promotion this would surely involve a wage increase in the normal world but they have no reason to give him one as he doesn't even know about his own promotion. Whole thing seems a bum deal for the worker tbh - I doubt they have a great union either lol. They must have to be real desperate to sign up for the job but I suspect this will be touched on soon

\- As for the blue thing I haven't thought too much about it. They all seem to have outfits but thats not too unusual for an office job anyway. Would be interesting to see if they go anywhere with it",1,1645239161,344

hxjkazj,2,orion_black,"Ditto on having gone in blind, and definitely was for the best. The way the pilot's narrative is structured works quite well with both the memory partitioning idea and to convey the new recruit's experience.

I noticed there's a clear divide between innie and outie tech. Innies have crts and cds while outies get lcds and smartphones, and well you know, mind-altering implants. What y'all make of it?  Some ideas:

* u/gullydowny idea of some form of ""perception bending"" going on has its appeal
* Technical reasons. Having very distinctly different visual cues could make memory ""filtering"" easier.
* Provides a bit of extra security. If your memories are ""leaking"", having them take place on a medieval monastery(or something) would make them more dubious.
* Old internet-less equipment is harder to hack(from the outside).
* A mix of weird corporate (indoctrination) practices that have been ""the way"" since forever",61,1645246831,149

hxjm3ow,2,ElmoreHayne,"I don't think that Delaware itself was important. The initial questioning is to test if they forget personal information (mother's eye color) but retain skill memory, the question is name a U.S. state or territory, so any state would have sufficed, Delaware is the first thing that probably popped into Helly's head. Remember Milchik told her Keir Egan's favorite breakfast before he procedure and she was asked about Egan's favorite breakfast and couldn't remember. The company is ascertaining whether or not the procedure worked, and as stated they retained skill memory, because an employee who couldn't remember how to type or know certain skills is useless.",55,1645247921,106

hxjnd1v,2,DwightUgnorantSlut,This is why I’m rewatching right now 😅 I definitely think there is a significance to food. I remember Mark’s outie’s sister saying something along the lines of “of course pips” signifying a certain connotation?,38,1645248694,35
hxjodqi,2,ElmoreHayne,"As to pre-selecting process, they probably have a psychological profile they are looking for, which Lumon can get in the resumes, applications, and aptitude tests everyone fills out when applying for a job. There are people who would like to forget 8 hours of their day. Take Mark, he's clearly using the severance process to not have to confront the pain of losing his wife. We also haven't seen Lumon's pitch for the severance process is, companies can make awful things sound appealing.

hxlh17r,2,HedgieX,"I just watched both episodes last night and it really blew me away. What a great concept for a show. I didn't know much about it going in other than the general idea of how the ""severance"" worked.

I hadn't thought of the implications. Like their ""innie"" being trapped in the office continuously and only the ""outie"" can decide to quit. But since the outie has no idea of the hell their innie is going through that probably doesn't happen. Maybe everyone they hire has some trauma so is happy to ""lose' 8 hours of their day every day and collect a paycheck for it. But its so bizarre and frightening.",70,1645289945,111
hxljm1l,2,AlphaCentauri-,"i see people talking about the bosses conflicting stories about her mother’s religiosity but i want to bring up a possibility:

we already know Lumon lies about what happens at work to your Outtie via Mark. 

then we see Irv getting his ‘Wellness Check’ where he’s given info about his Outtie. i find this highly dubious. im on the side of the boss *not* being severed, but who’s to say Lumon is *actually* giving your Innie true info about your Outtie?

like all that stuff was great things for Irv. but i didnt believe it. Irv’s Innie has no way of verifying any of this info… it’s given to make him feel good. so i wouldnt be surprised if the boss IS severed, they would give differing info to help keep the two lives separate. just an idea",54,1645290996,138

How would dreams work if they are asleep? Dreams are connected to your memories. So either they can only dream about work or the compartmentalization doesn't work in dreams and there's the danger they can learn something about their outside world.

I thought the shop comment was weird, but also justified it to myself that she has a part time job at her own shop. Which again, would be weird.

hxmj37t,2,ladylayton42,"So I’m really interested in the boundaries of memory in this, and I’m gonna get way to nit-picky for a science fiction show, but bear with me, because I’m really intrigued.

I believe the understanding is that they’ve retained their semantic memory, while losing their episodic and personal semantic memories;  I am on board with this.

Where this starts to get tricky is with other factual things that should, by all means, be semantic. If they can recall US states, and basic grammar rules, etc., where does it end?  If their outside self watched a movie in the outside a million times (allowing for some solid encoding to happen), can their inside self recall the events of the movie (not the experience of watching it, just the plot of the movie), or is that too personal?  A piece of media’s plot is not inherently personal, but having seen vs. not seen it can contribute to personality and can tell someone about themselves.

It seems (based on the film and music facts given to Irving in the wellness room) that they can’t remember things like media or current events.

But then how is that controlled for or differentiated without interfering with the rest of their (non-personal) semantic memories?",23,1645305788,207
hxmoyky,2,r0ssar00,"I imagine it also has a bit of 1984 thought-limiting effect on what employees could come up with if they wanted to exfiltrate anything: if you didn't know USB was a thing that existed, would you even think to consider trying to smuggle a microSD card out?

I chose a microSD card instead of a USB flash drive for the smuggled device deliberately: no one would even really be able to conceptualize the former without having an idea about the latter *and also* know that computers and data storage devices exist.

hxnefud,2,WhiskeyMakesMeHappy,"I think the ""facts"" are just another way to monitor if the severance is leaking. They're monitoring Irv through video as he hears ""facts"" about himself. If he unconsciously reacted suspiciously about any of the facts, it would imply he's retaining some kind of memory of his outtie.

Whereas if he reacts positively to the pleasant lies, it implies he is enjoying believing them, and thus that he isn't retaining any knowledge of what's going on with his Outtie and isn't suspicious that Lumon is lying to him.

hxnzq92,2,nevertoomuchthought,"When I first heard about this show the premise sounded appealing to me. One of the hardest things about working for me has always been separating my outside life from it. And because I would often take work and the stress that comes along with it home with me it became a sort of self-propagating issue. I was always miserable at my jobs because it was never just about the work. And I wished that it was. But I dwell on every miscommunication, mistake, misinterpretation, and anything my mind is willing  to read into. And the same went for personal problems impacting my work. Being able ignore those things while in the other sounded very pleasing on the surface.

This is nothing like that but close enough hat I really empathize with people who choose to work there. Which I think could be a hurdle for some people. But I totally get it.

What neighbor, one who (for the sake of not pissing anyone off about ages) is clearly in an age category above his, calls to discuss a matter such as this when they’re almost certain to cross paths within hours?
1a) phone call: receiving a call from a neighbor to begin with is odd (outside of an emergency);
1b) phone call: Mrs. Sekvig is his neighbor…wouldn’t she see him upon his arrival at home that evening and/or the next morning? The call itself is unnecessary and the timing is such that it’s the only time the company doesn’t literally have a leash on Mark (and happens to be meeting Petey-more correctly-Petey is introducing himself);

1c) phone call: all back to the phone call lol…if Mrs. Selvig/Mrs. Cobel were truly calling to resolve a situation (or action she and/or he took which caused confusion) there is literally no reason to ask WHERE he was eating. Am I right?;

2) the fact Mrs. Selvig is obsessed over such a trivial problem (or whatever situation) just seems like a ploy to continue to contact him in some way;

3a) appearance: although they are acquaintances (at best) she far too aware of how he smells and comments that he “smells good.” And she’s oddly curious…asking personal questions specifically regarding what he’d been doing that evening and if he’d been on a date (this is the biggest red flag to me) - what neighbor asks if they’d been out on a date while delivering cookies?

3b) appearance: Mrs. Cobel said he looked hungover during the first episode…which means she’s acutely aware of his daily appearance (sorta supports the “smell good” comment). 

My theory is the company is suspecting Petey will contact Mark, and perhaps even entertain the idea he could end up aiding and abetting him (since they were well-known work friends) hence the impromptu visit with cookies.

Is this a common theory? Or am I way off base? lol! I literally JUST saw it for the first time…of course it’s cued now!

The idea of thirds also seems to be a big theme so far. Another user noted that 1 of the 3 light bulbs being out in Mark’s apartment signifies his 8 hours of consciousness at work (a third of 24 hours)

You’ll also notice the 3 paintings behind Peggy in episode 1…the first 2 panels are calm but the third panel is a full on storm. Again seems to signify the hellish nature for the “person” trapped at work.

Of course that's true, but it's also a weird and specific thing to draw attention to. Is it some weird test of his memory as an ""outie"" (remembering that garbage is one day and recycling the next)? Or foreshadowing about what's going wrong in the world: that it's related to garbage/pollution? That could also tie into the black goo, focus on water, the greenhouse, etc. 

Irving's weirdness definitely goes beyond simply being older and falling asleep. There's obviously the black goo, but also the way he immediately tried to do a trust fall at the welcome party. I'm thinking severance really has a negative impact long term, and is affecting Irving because he's been working there the longest. 

I've also been thinking about the idea of ""re-severance"", that if something isn't working out with an ""innie"" or they need to transfer departments or something, they might ""kill"" the current innie and start everything all over again. That's not what happened with Mark, because we have info about when he started to work at the company, but could be the case for someone like Irving.

Those memories would not register in any capacity in the Innie's consciousness.

I think there is some suspension of disbelief required. The implant is already sci-fi, so it's not a big stretch to assume that it's smart enough to differentiate between personally-identifiable memories and general memories.

Based on the sea theory, the Innies don't even know the state of society. That means they don't have certain specific memories at all, such as what movies were released just before their Severance. I assume that, at the point of Severance, the implant compares the individual's memories to some pre-determined encyclopedia of general knowledge.

 &gt;Change blindness is a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when a change in a visual stimulus is introduced and the observer does not notice it. For example, observers often fail to notice major differences introduced into an image while it flickers off and on again. People's poor ability to detect changes has been argued to reflect fundamental limitations of human attention. Change blindness has become a highly researched topic and some have argued that it may have important practical implications in areas such as eyewitness testimony and distractions while driving.

hxwaq5r,2,Deferential_dreams,"I think you misunderstood me. Any personally-identifiable memories do not transfer over to the Innie, which would mean anything about your family, your preferences, non-general knowledge like how to make specific carpentry joints, etc.

My current theory is that the company has designed a complete tabula rasa consciousness that isn't formed from *any* of the host's original memories. This consciousness is implanted into the worker's brain to form the start of their Innie identity.

Imagine that a serial murderer is captured by the police. He says that he will continue killing the second he gets a chance. He has no hopes of rehabilitation. If you could just wipe his identity and have him start over as a functioning adult, wouldn't that be in the best interest of everyone? You'd turn him from a hopeless criminal to a functioning member of society who can learn to be happy and make others happy.

In fact, the whole experiment could be to form the best blank slate for resetting the identity of an adult. The numbers, the break room, the rehab... it could all be designed to study the tabula rasa consciousness in order to refine it. Even the way that they have you wake up is utterly bizarre - why would they spread you out on a table? Why would they wait so long to show you the video of your Outie consenting? It's all clearly designed as a test.

There's also a bit of foreshadowing about this when it was pointed out that Helly's Innie would essentially die if she quit for good; conversely, an Outie can also die if it is permanently replaced by an Innie.

The theme of death was also revisited by Milchick, when he stated that no one dies there in the office. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but the implication is that death is something that happens to Outies, not Innies.

Finally, Mark hints at this theme a little when he mentions that maybe the point of Severance is to not have to live your normal life for eight hours a day. Mark is depressed and possibly suicidal over the death of his wife. His Innie is much happier. Who's to say that Mark's Innie doesn't merit life just as much if not more than his Outie?

hy0b1tp,2,FastMoneyCam,Severance seems to be controversial though and Mark says they are trying to expand. So it seems that becoming severed is a choice not many people make which is why the floor seems to be so empty.

hy244pp,2,RealNotFake,"To me, the stairwell is not a representation of anything, it's a ""severance border"" that is used to test them. Similar to how Mark switched selves while he was riding the elevator down, so we know the severance flip can happen with some kind of proximity/location based sensors. I think the stairwell is one such boundary, and what we were seeing was only from the perspective of the 'innie'. In other words the innie walks through the stairwell and becomes the outie. The outie then makes the decision to walk back in, and then the innie resumes consciousness, and to them they never perceived the stairwell at all. I think it is used as a way to break their spirit and reinforce that they are mentally trapped within the walls and that their outie wants them to be there.",40,1645588801,139
hy25d39,2,RealNotFake,"That's a very good theory, given that they seem to have an emotional reaction to the numbers on screen. My spin on that is they are trying to erase the past trauma of their outie. I think the outies paid for this program with the understanding that their work self would be working for 8 hours trying to make them forget or be at ease with their life again. You can tell that Mark is pretty tortured by the death of his wife, and he literally avoids changing his light bulb because he dreads having to sort through his wife's belongings.

Also Mark's innie was saying he gets motivation from thinking about the effects of sleep, even though he didn't experience it. Maybe there is a similar thing going on when he erases/bins the trauma, since they share the same brain. And maybe that is what keeps the innies satisfied.",8,1645589397,150

His sister, loved ones being around, the chance to find love again (his failed date with the doula, oh I’m sorry, “midwife.”) Compared to a “hell” of fluorescent lights, no outside activities, monotony of staring at a computer with “scary numbers.” A purgatory elevator that’s only purpose is to take you from point A to point B. Brings the question, is there a heaven? What would that look like in this Severence universe? I love the questions this show presents!

I know they said it’s nearly impossible, but Carol D.’s outtie personality left the crew a thank you video when she left, which makes it seem possible. But would the corporate entity allow someone to really leave with the microchip still implanted? Assuming it is only activated in the building, it might be safe to say the person could essentially go back to life as known to their outtie self, but I fear the company wouldn’t risk any unknown threats walking around with the chip still in their brain. So maybe Carol D. was actually eliminated and no longer living…",1,1645648453,108
hy5as35,2,Horror_Platypus,"The outties believing that life as they know it is hell, resulting from tragedies experienced, grief, as we’ve seen from Mark’s outtie. And not knowing the monotony of the hell that is their job, seems a reasonable escape. A reviewer who has seen all of season one remarked that Irving is hiding from something. I’ve noticed a possible romantic interest in the Optics employee, Christopher Walken’s character, Burt. Perhaps his outtie struggles with his sexuality in life. I’m hoping each character gets their own episode (similarly seen in “The Leftovers” when we had an entire Nora episode). I’m dying to know Helly’s outtie, and why she chose severance, as well as Dylan and Irving. I recall Milchik telling Helly what she’s doing is a “miracle,” and wondered if this is something he tells all new employees, or if it was specific to her outtie character.",22,1645648736,145
hy5d54q,2,Horror_Platypus,"The timing of dialogue is interesting. The way Milchik speaks often sounds hypnotic, with a brainwashing element. When he tells Helly, “The office feels whole… Now. … Let’s get this party started.” Where it’s as tho he could be saying “The office feels whole now.” Or, “The office feels whole. Now, let’s get this party started.” I’m probably overthinking, but I’m using that as an example for how Milchik will speak smoothly and pleasantly, but when he’s giving thinly veiled warnings, his tone becomes slightly threatening. The current refiners’ reaction to the slight tone change appear almost admonished and scared. (Probably of what happens in the break room.)",2,1645649590,108
hy5fi55,2,RealNotFake,"All great questions, and I expect many of this to be explored this season, or at least I hope so!

hy5fija,2,Horror_Platypus,"And Irv tells Dylan, “I’m sorry I was hired older than you.” I first believed he said this because his age means he would become director before Dylan. Then, I realized it was most likely referring to his age as the reason he dozed off, not potential promotion because Mark is promoted over Irving, and he’s younger. This means that promotion doesn’t happen because of age. Can’t be because of length of employment either, since he’s been there 3 years and Mark, only 2. Maybe it’s due to Mark’s “Freshman Fluke,” he was promoted over Irv. 

Another thing I’ve wondered is if “dozing off” isn’t simply falling asleep. Is the black goo what happens when your innie falls asleep? Maybe when Irving first saw it underneath his fingernails, he was just tired. Then, the accumulation was falling asleep. But, maybe, it’s depression? The wellness lady’s purpose for giving you pleasant facts about your outtie’s life is to give you something to help depression that sneaks into the innie’s consciousness? I was just thinking, why don’t they just give him a cup of coffee when he dozed off? Could be both, the facts giving him reason to complete the day, so his “exemplary outtie” can enjoy some dances and swimming, a reason to live as well as stay awake and out of the break room.",3,1645650459,224
hy5gsky,2,Horror_Platypus,"Probably why the wellness lady gives them pleasant facts about their outties. It helps them to know they do have happiness, kind of like when Mark says they don’t experience sleep but it helps to acknowledge the benefits they experience—rested, less tension. Them just knowing their other self has reason to live, maybe they do too. So, a reason to not want to kill their innie self. Maybe the curiosity of the outtie life also keeps them motivated to continue the work existence. 

Idk. I think Helly’s continued rebellion may answer some of these questions. Or, maybe they’ve all had rebellion in the beginning. It’s been alluded that both Mark and Petey tried to leave at one point or another. There seems to be a hypnosis element happening as well, we’ve heard the tape of Mark in the break room repeating his repentance over some unknown wrong doing.",9,1645650933,148

Outtie Helly seems eager and a little excited for the process, but also warns she might “freak out” on Milchik after she’s wiped. (Most people would.) But it gives us a tiny glimpse of her self awareness, and although she seems happy she’s getting severed, she knows she’s got a rebellious streak. It seems that she has shown how their inner personality remains intact, but perhaps the brainwashing/hypnotic break room changes their personalities.

hy7mc9g,2,Horror_Platypus,"So true. I love how you put “the mindset carrying over,” because our outer versions rarely depict our inner feelings and true self. What we show the world, may be different from how we actually feel in our own reality. Especially in the work place. People have that version of themselves where even their ‘professional voice’ differentiates from the voice they have at home (I believe Petey even remarks that Mark’s outtie voice is “different… worse.”) When you think about it, who actually gets you when you’re completely yourself, no filter whatsoever? It could be only your dog (or whatever type of pet). We all have versions of ourself for everyone we encounter, even our closest love ones. 

Maybe Helly is incredibly eager to escape something in real life, but her inner self, one cultivated since birth, isn’t quite on board to this new unknown reality and it’ll be interesting to see how she adapts, or maybe doesn’t adapt at all, in future episodes.

hycs7ge,3,queenlionheart,"The editing is so bonkers, I love it. The only thing I wasn't *too* huge a fan of was the convenience of Mark choosing to follow a random ambulance and happening to see Petey.

Something I noticed, to me it felt like there was a shift in Milchick's attitude at the end of the breaking room session with Helly, directly after he glances at Harmony. It's either that he's actually exasperated by Helly's attitude or he doesn't really want to be a part of this. Which makes me wonder if he could be a potential ally for Mark and co, or if he had some part in helping Petey? The break room has a recording device, so maybe he helped record Petey's smuggled tape?

Another interesting note, it was also shown that every CEO (at least of the name plaques we see) died while in office except for Gerhardt Eagan (the first woman CEO) who lived from 1920-1991 and was in office 1976-1987.

hycu3r0,3,Vincent_adultman98,"Loving this show so far, so here's my big theory.

The company is testing the Severance procedure for mass use, and it's not widely available yet.

They establish that the company is medical/tech, meaning they are exactly the people that would be in charge of surgery and implanting a microchip. I believe that the project isn't just about severance, but making workers believe what Lumen wants them to. The news and Marks Sister know about severance, but I believe these are just more tests to see if they can create entire scenarios in the workers minds. 

The numbers are just numbers, but they're part of a long term project to see if they can make the innies feel emotions by using complex combinations of numbers so they can use that to make them more productive workers, as well as help with Lumen testing the implants of thoughts.  

This is why Harmony lives next door and seems obsessed with Mark. She's making sure the procedure is taking and going well. I'm sure there's people following the other members of the crew, and they might even have known about Petey but wanted to see The downsides of the procedure being reversed.

Main questions so far: 

1.Who's the mole? Someone must have given Petey the tape with Mark in the break room and gotten Petey out. Who did it?

2. What's going on with the board? Why do they not speak and just listen?",40,1645776020,241

The water part, it seems to me that there are too many references to people drinking, there being beer in abundance, the fish tank in the house, Irv being told he loves water in his session and smiling, etc. My line of thought is that: humanity, facing water wars, gave up the majority of its food supply when Lumen was able to create whatever product/service that makes food no longer necessary for people to live, and that Lumen is positioning itself as the steward of the region/country/world's water.

It will be interesting to see if the food/water issue actually gets explored, because I feel like it's a fantastic metaphor for the labor severance process at the core of the story. I hope there is this massive world out there that they can reveal and dig into over time.",7,1645807372,146

Founded by Kier Eagan

“The remembered man does not decay.” - Kier Eagan

“History lives in us whether we learn it or not. - Jame Eagan

“Come now children of my industry, and know the children of my blood.” - Jame Eagan

“I know that death is near upon me because people have begun to ask what I see as my life’s great achievement. They wish to know how they should remember me as I rot. In my life I have identified four components, which I call tempers, from which are derived every human soul. Woe. Frolic. Dread. Malice. Each man’s character is defined by the precise ratio that resides in him. I walked into the cave of my own mind, and there I tamed them. Should you tame the tempers, as I did mine, then the world shall become but your appendage. It is this great and consecrated power that I hope to pass on to all of you, my children.- Kier Eagan

""I think to be an Eagan, either a true Eagan or anyone working in this Lumon family, what you are is a keeper of an ethos, a compact of values that we have long held as precious, and which I do believe will one day save this world. And that ethos goes all the way back through my blood to where we all started, with Kier. When I was a girl, my father would make me whisper…\[unintelligible\] Vision, Verve, Wit, Cheer, Nimbleness, Probity, Wiles…\[more unitelligible\]."" - Myrtle Eagan

I think he’s realized Petey is a close friend rather quickly, even though he is virtually a stranger to outtie Mark.

Perhaps Burt and Irving became employed there to forget each other and why they work in different departments, ones that seem to not trust each other. That being said, it’s interesting that it seems Irv only recently met Burt, even tho he’s worked there 5 years (I believe that’s what he said in the team building game). I also don’t think it’s a coincidence they have bumped into each other now, first in the wellness waiting room, and then the labyrinth hallway. 

I keep having a theory that the black goo Irv saw is depression seeping into the innie consciousness, which is why his wellness session’s purpose was to instill pleasant thoughts. Maybe why they had them bump into each other knowing that at one point the two had a good relationship, almost reliving the excitement of meeting someone knew. Imagine being able to start over a failed relationship and experience the exciting beginning for the first time again. Risky move by the corporation because who’s to say it wouldn’t sour a second time.

I don't think this is the case because Irving has been there 3 years, while Mark has been there about 2.

That's an interesting point about the brain adapting ways around the chip, though. I'm not sure what to make of that possibility yet. Because on the one hand, you have the board who seems to think severance is irreversible. But on the other, everyone on the MDR team is relatively new. Nobody's been there 5, 10, 20+ years. Is that because severance doesn't last very long before ... something happens? 

How long has severance been a thing? Long enough for there to be protest groups and news debates. But is that just a few years? Or decades? Why are there no real old timers on the team? We only know about Petey and Carol D. How long were they there? How many other people have been on the team as severed employees, and what eventually happened to them?

Couple of other things:
- Could Helly and Milchick be moles/the people who helped Petey? Could they be close on the outside? They obviously know each other from the way they act together on the outside- and Milchick presents her with flowers after her first day. That's also weird given the apparent prohibition on innies knowing each other outside (although Milchick himself isn't severed). The part where Milchick tells her she's doing an amazing thing just before Helly has the device implanted- could that thing be going 'undercover'? 

- What's the deal with the break room? Why doesn't Helly just refuse to go along? She's not threatened or even told she can't leave until she reads the statement. What wodve happened had she refused? Also interested that's it's called a 'compunction statement'- a feeling of anxiety arising from awareness of guilt.

- Based on the above they 'pass' the break room statement when the monitors register sufficient anxiety, right? Made me think about the numbers eliciting fear, the wellness session, the Eagan screed about balancing four temperaments and...am I right in thinking they sort the numbers into four different baskets?

Whatever the case is, I feel like the world is being manipulated to buy whatever Lumon is selling, and the methods the company uses to become a global “need” are severe, possibly apocalyptic.

Of course, it's still up in the air whether the code detectors are real. I'm 50/50 on that still.

More broadly, I didn't like retconning additional Cylons, the disappearance and return of Starbuck, the rehabilitation of many Cylons after their relentlessly genocidal beginnings, or any of the weird, gauzy, spiritual mumbo-jumbo.  I also hated their attempt to make out the United States as equivalent to Cylons, as if we had ever tried to nuke and destroy the entire Iraqi population.

But there's no doubt the finale had the most absurd moment of all, deciding to go without technology as though people would be happy to just scratch around in the dirt after they were used to mattresses and toilet paper and medicine and recorded music.

One thing it seems fair to ask is that you actually see video of your outie refusing, although that could I suppose be deepfaked.   And if this were ever allowed in reality, which is doubtful, they would have to insist that both the outie and innie agree to continue.

For the innie who gets the request denied, there is of course no way to know whether the outie even received it or whether the company is just lying.  Although in this case we do know that her outie must have gotten the message that she at least initially didn't like it by the way she kept running through the door.

The fact that resigning is suicide for the self that lives at work made me initially think that one answer could just be actual suicide.  Upon further consideration, though, that's pretty harsh for the outie.  But it gives me an idea.  You could inflict steadily more severe cuts to your neck, which is a way to send a message to your outie that is both a cry for help and a kind of threat.

When it is time for a new Eagan to become CEO they take on the persona that is created from this experiment.

This seems implausible at first because lumon has been around since 1866 and only recently developed the severance procedure. I actually think this helps the theory. The current ceo is the most acclaimed. I think this is because the pervious Eegan’s did not approach this quest for balancing the tempers in a rigorous enough manner. 

Previous Eagan’s could not literally create new personalities. They ran rough workplace experiments where people fit the tempers in a general sense but not to the level that lumon now can.

To respond to your comment though: 

First, I don’t know if Marks reaction signaled that he recognized her or not, TBH. I feel like there’s some leeway here, because even if he did recognize her, there’s not much suggesting that his reaction would have been different. 

Second, Mark has shown us that he doesn’t really pay attention to the world around him, especially when it comes to the issue of severance/Lumen. Also, the fact that he resulted to childish debate techniques when discussing it with the whole mind collective guy (“how old are you? are you even in high school?!”, etc) and the lack of response he had at the dinner party when they asked basic questions, suggests that he hasn’t thought very deeply about this issue at all.

hynxj2w,3,Daffodil_ass,"I just watched the first 3 eps last night and haven't stopped thinking about it all! I agree with lots of theories people are sharing here, so I don't want to repeat my thoughts that have already been said. But I do have another theory that I haven't seen talked about (yet) so figured I'd throw it out there-

I think Harmony is definitely severed as well. I don't think there is any proof of her being an unsevered worker. There is the one scene in her house when she's wearing braids and her disposition is distinctly different. She is watching Mark, but in a very different sad and concerned way. When we first learn of her through Mark's phone conversations, the fumbling woman who screws up her trash bins does not align with the woman who creepily melts ice on her front steps while fully dressed to monitor Mark. I don't think the bins are a planned surveillance sabotage of Mark's psyche. I really think it is a struggle of Harmony's outie's life.

I think this theory is supported by other theories of multiple elevators that do not ding the implant chips when they first ""check in"" to work, and then can go back up a different route. I think her work hours must vary dramatically from Mark's. Her hours are much, much longer. Severed workers like her (and possibly also Milchik) can effectively be innies outside in the town. 
This theory is also supported by the blue and red theme. Harmony is hecking up her bins of the two colors. 

What's unusual is she did not even notice the red envelope right on Mark's kitchen table as they sat there. I think this scene was her outie. She snoops on him because her outie is low key fixated on Mark's life. Innie Harmony noticed and confiscated the brown book package, but then handed it to Milchik for him to open. Can ""securely"" severed workers not see or not interact with red outside items? Hmm. I saw someone else theorize that Harmony could be Mark's mother in law, which would also explain her going right into his deceased wife's crafts, but I'm not super convinced yet. More importantly, the candle was also split colors. If his wife had that candle, she must have also been involved in some way. 

Unrelated, but what I can't explain in this story- why is Mark's sister presented as such a reasonable lady who is considerate of Mark, but her husband is such an absolute dingus of a human. How is that marriage compatible in a way that doesn't jump out at the viewer! Rickon and their friends are so bizarre that it's hard to see how it isn't intentional for some internal part of the story. Their personalities are very dramatic. Might have something to do with these four facets of souls. 

One other thing that strikes me as weird- we see Natalie on the TV debating in favor of the right to choose Severance. She uses the term ""workie"" rather than ""innie."" Innie and outie are openly discussed terms between the innies we meet. Why would she use the wrong term on tv? Who would that benefit? Does Natalie also have an outie who does not fully understand what she is trying to advocate for? 

Edited to add another thought: Petey as we see him remains an innie still. He escaped through the different elevator and his outie has never been re-activated. This explains why he can only search for Mark to connect with, and hides out in the greenhouse when he says he has a daughter. I beleive his innie was told small details of his outie during Wellness, which may or may not even be true tbh, but he cannot functionally use this information on the outside.

I was thinking it had something to do with DNA editing? I was trying to think about clues in the shows title and in the company's name. Maybe ""Severing"" genes, which would play into the title well. Or, maybe Lumon is developing something like an ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" product, where they're killing painful memories for people. Maybe they're working on their own minds and the company is using that to inform their product for the masses?

I also think the theory that the workers are the product test subjects is interesting, but I don't think that's right since the corporation genuinely cares about the output of their work - the work they do is highly valuable to the company.

Separately, I noticed water is a subtle theme. Mark and his date have full glasses of water at the restaurant. Mark and his sister go to that dinner party that's an odd water drinking party. Mark's coworker's theory about what the data points are is that it's the sea.

Also, I'm not sure if its significant but we don't really know what the time period is. Is it a dystopian future where we've regressed back to cube computers, or is it the 90s?

They sign up for severance, and from then on everything is based on how they *feel*, both inside and outside the facility. The innies are working for 8hrs to isolate trauma memories, e.g. ""scary numbers"", and bin them. The innies are put through an emotional rehabilitation, something of a 'hot and cold therapy for the mind'. They have the wellness center for positive, they have the perpetuity wing for purpose, they have the break room for punishment and remorse, etc.

In the real world, Mrs. Selveg(sp) is gradually trying to remove memories of Mark's wife. When she was snooping in the basement she opened his memory box that we know is painful for him, and she took out a single item. She is also very concerned all the time about how Mark is feeling on the outside.

Mrs. Selveg is her alter ego and her only purpose for living there is to monitor Mark's progress. Or at least that's my theory, haha.

I think they are all part of a group consciousness that's feeding the “MIND” area on the map.

Kier may be a digital consciousness as opposed to a human. Also, in the opening credits Mark is seated at a desk inside the head of a version of himself.

I thought about her replacing someone too but I don't think that's the case. I think that they just moved her office to a different location on the floor.

 yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm). Lumon is a pharma company,

I remember being 18 years old, and watching one of the beheading videos on one of those fucked up websites back in the day and it haunted me for a decade. It was the disturbing I had ever seen, still to this day, to watch a video of someone being killed in such a brutal way, and it just stuck with me when I heard the interview about how these people were treaded before hand. 

Back then we kinda just took officials at face value when they spoke about serious issues so it never occured to me to try and ""fact check"" it back then, It just seemed true because I remember that man reading his ""confession"" in such a calm way, with the blade to his neck. Originally I just thought he was so broken from torture that he didnt care anymore, but when I heard the interview describe how the victims were put through these rehearsals over and over, it kinda made sense to me why the person wasnt crying, shaking, pissing their pants moments before the final act. They assumed that it would be just like every time before, when nothing happened. 

It could be Fake news or whatever but the statements just logically made sense with what I had seen.

I must say I don’t think it’s an experiment- unless they’re a/b testing different ways to sever/manage severed people.

Also recurring theme - the first 20 or so mins of each ep are at a slow pace but the tension ramps up along with the pacing beautifully in the last 40 mins of each show and I never want it to end - I'm addicted to the formula

\*spoilers ahead\* 

Great to see more of Walken in this one - his scenes with Irving were compelling. and the reveal at the end that its \*a bit\* more than just a 2 person department shocked me. Not sure what this will mean. Perhaps Dylan was right about O&amp;D being bad vibes

Helley - wow. incredibly dramatic even though we knew what she was gonna do. 99% sure we will see her again but my mind is already racing with ways she will survive. You would think she would have been watched closer given her actions. Also that reminds me we know the department is crawling with cameras and monitoring devices but they were openly discussing ""contraband"" maps and books all day without Graner/Milchik stepping in?? Not to mention they are seemingly completely free to roam about the corridors as they see fit which surprised me

Selvig/Cobel continues to creep me out. She is on the cusp of proving reintegration with Peteys chip and the fact Mark made a tree out of clay (presumably representing the tree where his wife died in a car accident). If she can prove it to the board this surely puts Mark's safety at risk

Also just had a thought. The break room must be almost as mentally exhausting for Milchik as it is for the victims lol. Kinda wish Helley had just outright refused to give the apology.

 &gt;Retrofuturism (adjective retrofuturistic or retrofuture) is a movement in the creative arts showing the influence of depictions of the future produced in an earlier era. If futurism is sometimes called a ""science"" bent on anticipating what will come, retrofuturism is the remembering of that anticipation. Characterized by a blend of old-fashioned ""retro styles"" with futuristic technology, retrofuturism explores the themes of tension between past and future, and between the alienating and empowering effects of technology.

hza340i,4,Xhazhu,"I love surreal type vibes from movies and TV, where on the surface everything SEEMS normal but there is an air of something wrong just beyond, so this show feels made for me. The whole time they are in the severed area of Lumon, it’s like another world. Love every second of it. 

Irv is my fav by far, it’s basically told to us that he’s been severed and at his position the longest. It totally makes sense that, since their reality as innies is confined solely to the basement of Lumon, that his religious attachment to the handbook and lore of the company would be something that might develop over time. It’s all that version of him knows, and I find his whole philosophy so interesting. It’s the dude from work that “drank the kool aid” but to the nth degree. 

The show also really investigates super interesting topics with their separated memories. Hellys innie vs outtie conflict is so fascinating, this power struggle between two versions of the same person. The outtie claiming that she is in control, that she calls the shots really makes the ending of this episode hit home, with her innie defiantly spitting in the face of that claim. I really don’t see her being dead, more like a chess move and attempt to retake control.

Petey is ‘reintegrated’ aka both selves merged back together. ‘Resignation’ is the sense that the outtie life takes back primacy. However I think they are gonna lay on us a ‘promotion’ scenario where the innie gets promoted to ‘full time’ where they become primary and the outtie ‘dies’, the opposite of the resignation scenario.

We get the impression Lumon is subservient to the outtie - that they have control, they decided to do this, it’s all up to them. But it might be a more predatory scenario. The tormented outtie ‘dies’ and born again as the innie.

Since we know smartphones exist (Mark has one), I lean towards Petey's phone being a burner. So then who knows who's calling.

They're playing certain sounds in the background to make them associate their bad behavior with the pain their subconscious associates with those sounds.

* Milchick tells her outie they were so excited to hear she was coming. Is he just saying that to make her feel good (does he say it to every new severed employee?), or is there really something special about her? Same with the flowers on her first day.

* If she really is someone important, the timing sure is convenient as she starts the day after Petey leaves. Was she waiting in the wings and ready to go at a moment's notice? If she's not really a VIP, maybe she was just the first candidate who was ready and willing to get started right away?

According to the Protestant work ethic, which seems to inform a lot of what we see as the philosophy of the company's founder, it's work that gives life meaning--so it's more like the outtie would be the non-person if anyone is.

And how are the executives of the company supposed to feel about a statement like that?  It comes across as very dismissive of the importance and value of what they do there, whatever it is.  Certainly her message does not square well with the wellness and restoration office or whatever it's called.

The innies are living in a cult they literally cannot escape from, even when they’re smart enough to see through the BS.

Also, your entire existence is **only** when you’re actively participating in “church” activities, and you’re not like a Tom Cruise level person, you’re one of the people they treat like absolute shit.

To go further, I'd say she is trying to keep in line with the family beliefs said in the perpetuity wing by the Eagon recordings.  Protecting the ethos as stated by myrtle eagon and keeping her tempers balanced as stated by Keir Eagon i.e malice, frolic, woe, and dread.  Her outtie has had an abundance of frolic and malice (being the heir to multi-billion dollar company and overindulging/being a cold bitch), so now her innie gets all the woe and dread to balance the tempers out.

This episode really made me think about the cult like mindset that’s still needed to maintain control at Lumen and the lengths Lumen goes to just to keep things in check. It’s not enough to just sever peoples brains. You need to put them in a cult like environment, you need to punish (aka psychologically torture/break) them for rule breaking, and you need to provide them with the occasional will to live via wellness checks that remind them of why their “outie” is important. 

Helly could just be a way to show us what a new hire goes through, she just happens to be a particularly chaotic new hire that Lumen wasn’t at all prepared for— and if that’s the case, her dying this early actually makes sense.",6,1646388361,165

Nevertheless in the real world you have other people around when you go home from work but here this is effectively the only world they know. Thus having distracting cravings for a co-worker seems inevitable. Also it would lead to wandering behavior which we may have seen in this episode (not sure if they're 'going there' with two veteran actors). Moreover, if you wanted to get out of there wouldn't anti-social behavior like constantly hitting or hitting on your co-workers be a lot more productive than hanging yourself? So there should be a way to tamp down people's emotions &amp; libido besides the weirdo founder philosophy.

I feel like she is too important a character to die, though.

I just started watching this show a few days ago, but it's already so fascinating to me. The way that each character tries to ""keep in line"" in their own way, yet are each subverting the rules privately. Mark's outie obviously knows Petey's secret, while Mrs. Selvig/Harmony is keeping her identity a secret from him. Mark's innie is shook by Helly's rebellious nature and the discovery of the map and book, and I loved that shot of Mark internally debating what to do with the angel (Irving) and devil (Dylan) over each shoulder. Dylan seems to have no allegiances towards anyone (including the company), while Irving is completely by the book and a stickler for the rules. That is, until tempted by his ""forbidden"" workplace romance with Burt. And Helly herself is an enigma because her innie seems to be the polar opposite of her stringent outer self. How did she manage to wind up working at Lumon Industries and is her outie an important character to the company? (Perhaps she was *forced* to record that video back to her inner self?)

It's possible that just as innies have the break room for workday contrition, outties are expected to show loyalty and dedication to the program when asked.

She threatens innie Helly in the video that if innie Helly tries to harm herself (as way of getting out), that she will keep innie Helly in there forever.

Innie Helly can simply refuse to work - if she has 0% productivity, or chooses to nap all day, is Lumon going to pay outie Helly?  (Milchick told Irv that his nap time would be deducted from his outie's pay, so lack of performance has to have some effect on compensation.)

The show is pretty strongly setup to show that they give up a ton of autonomy to the company. We don’t know exactly why people are willing to do it, but we know they do. It’s not a far fetched theory for a med tech company to own their technology. My friend is a neuroscientist and does experiments on rats. The company owns the rats. The people in lumon are clearly allegories to rats in a lab. More credence to the idea that lumon owns their bodies.

Also look up how company towns work. They can block autopsies. And if they own all the medical examiners, they would just tell them to not do the autopsy or lie about the results.",5,1646420050,137

But I don’t believe that they’ve only just met, but that they’re just getting acquainted with each other, and they’re seeing each other as kindred spirits. In that, they’re attracted to each other and are bonding. That’s why I see the intimacy as romantic rather than erotic, and there hasn’t been any body language or anything else indicating any sexual element, just their shared interests and Irving’s fascination and admiration for Burt and his work.

And you’re right about what they know of conventional social cues, as the only ones they know are the ones prescribed by their work environment, which are extremely limited. To them, this level of intimacy between coworkers is probably considered taboo, which likely adds to the thrill of discovery/being discovered— hence my “in a 1984 sort of way” comment earlier. I don’t know if you’ve read that book or seen the film, but there’s a forbidden romance in that story that begins not unlike this one.

In any case, these two are the innocents you describe, and they’re navigating these new feelings the best they can: slowly, fearful, surreptitiously, and carefully. Who knows where it will go?

Just one question though - who else feels that letting Mark conduct the 'introduction' or whatever it was that Petey used to do to new employees/trainees when he was barely prepared was a bit of a miss in the writing? I know it's what leads to Helly's storyline but that first meeting being so important i feel like the 'screw up' should have happened in a more convincing manner.

His book was conveniently discovered by Irving, unattended in the seemingly unsupervised conference room just after Burt and Ernie (uh, Irving's) O&amp;D tour that his coworker Felicia quickly exited beforehand. Why would Milchick even bring the book there, of all places? The prior episode shows him studying it in the restricted reception room outside Harmony's office.

Parts were read separately by Mark and Dylan - the two cynical yet moderate team members - **over several hours** in their perceived workspace privacy. The other two were more proactive in pushing beyond their workspace boundaries within the expectations of their  personalities. Yet middle management was ***visibly absent and unconcerned*** in any of their whereabouts or behavior.

B&amp;E do/did share an outie relationship much less tolerated within their age group, leading to Irving's severance years ago due to personal and social pressures. Burt, like Harmony, began/remains a fully cognizant Lumen research worker, in part as a private mutual agreement to continually monitor both Irving's *innie and outie stability*.

One of the objections was about when they'd sleep in such a scenario.

Didn't post it at the time but made me think about some animals (dolphins are one, I think) that never fully go to sleep and instead keep one hemisphere of the brain operating while the other one rests, then switch periodically so both hemispheres get a rest. 

What made me think of this again was the video at Petey's funeral of Enter Sandman- 'sleep with one eye open'? Also, it's an obvious fit with the idea of getting severed.

Can't be the full story (the outside world must be real, otherwise how does Ricken's book get into the office)- but perhaps part of it?

Also, from what Petey's daughter says to Mark at the funeral, seems like all severed workers have some sort of trauma/mental issues. Backed up by the map- 'we're here because we're not all there'.",11,1646439676,198

That could be why they are watching him so closely? See what he knows? Since him and petey were so close? And supposedly both unhappy? He also asked petey if they were after him.

My personal theory is that Ricken's book is going to spearhead the Revolution, and the Innies will take over and destroy the sensors that ""switch them"", escaping into the real world and effectively killing off their Outies. 

Tbf that theory probably won't be how it turns out. I think they're spending too much time on Mark as a character outside work to kill him off like that... but I think it'd be an interesting concept to explore, at least if one of them gets outside the building without switching.

Since she has no problem taking aspects from Mark's innie and outie lives and using them interchangeably in front of Mark to see if he notices, she might be referring to the map Petey made.

What if they all turned to God in their low points, became religious and now they're being used by a satanic cult or an opposite world to point out what they feel is wrong with the bible.

You can hit me and beat me and kill me. Then, you will have my broken body. NOT my submission."" When Lumon meets an inmovable object, someone deadset on leaving like Helly, they have no other choice but to let her go. Bc the other alternative is resort to violence until death. At which point theyll have a dissapearance to manage, and still not gotten the submission.

Resisting submission until death is always an option for those with that suicidal will. And Helly has it. I'm amazed she didn't just resort to filling the rest of her career at Lumon with 8h/day break room. (Thus also making sure Milchick is taken up 8/day torturing someone. Thus taking 2 employees' produ tivity  down to zero fulltime. And giving the others respite from supervision). It would be in the best interest of Lumon to simply allow her to quit. Less hassle. Theyll either need to find a new Milchick, who's morally bankrupt and competent, or get a newbie to torture Helly all day. Who would probably also revolt at having to do that as a job. Also, once Helly clogs up the breakroom, no one else can use it. Or do they have several? Helly deciding to double down on refusing submission and accepting dictation-torture would ruin Lumon. 

I feel like the average ukranian or someone from a hard part of the world would be enough to break the entire severance wing of Lumon.

Once vetted, Milchick turned the book over to O&amp;D for more in-depth analysis. Felicia, knowing Irving would reveal it to the entire MDR team, planted it so O&amp;D could study their responses.

The company is a pharma trying to solve trauma by complete disassociation from it via surgical procedure. But what we see is how each character handles their own suffering, trauma, and grief in somewhat classical ways.

Some turn themselves into cultish believers, others ignore the pain at all costs, and others are in denial. But as Helly says to ""painless Helly"" , ""you are not a person"" (without the pain). And the reality is that without our sufferings we might as well not be.

A lot of people have suggested that the MDR work is meaningless and that the team is being monitored in an experiment, and whether or not an innie is moved to suicide or self harm could be an interesting variable. Also, Milchick’s line was “death doesn’t happen here” not explicitly “you can’t die” on the inside.

Let’s leave the suicide thing aside though.  Before that Helly just wanted to leave/quit.  Doesn’t Innie Helly realize that if she “quits”— she/Innie Helly/the only existence she knows, will cease to exist?  Eg she will die.. why would Innie Helly want to cease to exist?

I didn't really think about it until two details stood out:

1) in this episode when mark goes to the tree that his wife supposedly died at in a car accident, there is still police tape around the scene. This struck me as odd because Mark's wife is supposed to have died over two years ago. Does this mean that we are watching a memory of mark grieving for her?

Even deeper dive, is our ability to view the memory and then see the wellness treatment mean maybe they are refining/deleting the memory from his outie so that his innie can construct the tree with the candle? The end of the wellness scene made it seem like that memory was being literally molded into a new innie memory where the tree has nothing to do with a car crash and he is losing his memory of his wife dying in that manner forever?

&amp;#x200B;

2) a smaller detail but nothing in this show seems left to chance- when mark arrrives for work in previous episodes the parking lot is full of cars, thus he has to park far away towards the edge of the parking lot. But even though the innies seem to get out of work after a regular eight hour shift, there are no cars in the parking lot when Mark leaves, other than Helly's. Which makes no sense if they are staggered in and out off the office so that they don't accidentally run into each other. Plus, where are all the other people who should be leaving the huge complex around the same time of five pm? Why are all their cars gone? Are they losing more than eight hours as innies? is that why the analog clocks only in the severed floor? Do they think they are clocking in for an eight hour shift but having more time stolen from them? otherwise why would they show scenes of an empty parking lot at a normal ""clock out"" time for a huge company?",8,1646526185,350

She doesn't _ask_ him to turn it off, she _tells_ him to turn it off. There's an air of authority when she says it -- like she's used to giving orders to everyone around her. 

Based on her condescending, even cruel demeanor, in her video reply to her Innie, I suspect that Outtie Helly holds some high level corporate position -- either at Lumon, but more likely at another company that's considering adopting the severance procedure. Outtie Helly is just giving Innie Helly a trial run -- unbeknownst to Innie Helly, her position at Lumon as a member of the Data Refinement Team was never intended to be permanent.  

This is why Innie Helly is doing everything she can to get out of her situation. As someone in a position of power, Outtie Helly would never actually choose to subject herself permanently to the life of a severed worker. It was supposed to be just a test -- maybe she volunteered for no reason other than simple curiosity. Which would make her suicide, if Innie Helly is successful, all that more tragic.  

Outtie Helly appears to have a superiority complex and she's probably used to being obeyed without question. The idea that a subordinate like Innie Helly would have the audacity to rebel and go against her wishes infuriates Outtie Helly to no end. Even if that subordinate is a version of her severed self. 

Innie Helly hanging herself in the elevator would be a big FU to Outtie Helly. I hope she survives just so we get to see Outtie Helly's reaction to being out-maneuvered by someone she normally looks down on and treats with contempt. Haughty Outtie Helly might be due for a rude awakening.

hzjozfe,4,LilRedCheese,"Am I supposed to start this thread with Spoiler Alerts? (Not the most familiar with Reddit but discussion of Severance elsewhere is barely high school level.) I only talk about eps 1-4 so all readers here should be caught up.

I'm trying to find a discussion on red. Yes, the color. Red is the color of the outside world. Mark's outtie wears a red shirt. Mark has a bright red fish that swims sadly behind him while he watches TV and gets drunk. He also drinks a lot of wine at home. Is it red?? I have to look at that again. Pete's robe at Mark's house is red. Ricken's book is reddish/orange. When Mark goes to the funeral, there's red everywhere: roses, curtains, etc. Even Mrs. Selvig wears clothes with patches of red in the outtie world &amp; at the funeral. Mark goes to the bar and orders whiskey. But what libations are available at the funeral bar? Just wine. Mark orders red. And here's the last thing. What color is Helly's hair? Red. Do we know what Helly stands for yet? I don't want to go down this rabbit hole too far in case it's not, but is it Helena? There are lots of stories about Helena throughout history. Here is one: ""St. Helena, Discoverer of the True Cross."" Also, the show is very, very biblical &amp; cultish (same/same). There is only one book in the innie world. In fact, the author of the book commands readers to not read lesser books. Oh boy, has that been a topic of conversation in recent years at, say, school board and library meetings.

As for who Helly-- with the bright red hair --is, when she comes in for her Severance procedure, Millchick is fawning over her, which I guess is a polite way to treat any new member to a cult. But he also says it's a ""miracle"" that she's there to be part of the program (in fairness, it's another thing you say when someone joins your cul...er...religion). Past ep. 4, there's still a lot yet to be revealed, but keep an eye on red. It's almost as significant in Severance as it was in that ancient flick, The Sixth Sense.",2,1646546998,372
hzjpgv6,4,LilRedCheese,"I just wrote a bunch about the color red and now I have some thoughts about Helly? If I'm not in the right place, I apologize. 

By episode 3, I was convinced Helly volunteered as a spy. In ep 4 when she berates and puts her innie in her place on that ""I resign again!"" video, it's a kind of way of scolding her innie for not going through with the plan. And it's not like her outtie could've coddled her innie to be more complacent and go through with the plan because she went undercover. And outtied Helly probably knew she was sacrificing what would become innie Helly and came to terms with that self punishment. (Of course, there's still a lot to learn about those videos when/how they were made/originated. The characters are reading pre-written remarks.) BUT, after watching ep. 4, i'm wondering if Helly was actually more important in the world-- perhaps a celebrity. But not like a movie star because people would be wondering what Helly would be doing taking a 9-5 at a controversial, non-entertainment company like Lumen. But a big shot in a particular world. Politics? Eh, not sure. Mark may have recognized her that first day in the parking lot. Corporate higher-up? Maybe a Lumen owner (not part of the Egan family)? You can tell she's commanding and in charge. It is possible she's part of the Egan family (different last name) went astray at some point and it's a miracle she decided to be the prodigal daughter and do the whole thing from the ground up.   
I should have looked at other threads for Helly's origin--and still can, I guess. If you know of any, i'm happy to redirect these thoughts.",1,1646547300,289

Whenever one of them chose not to work (like goof around all day) it killed the productivity of the entire team and effected all of our bonuses. Sometimes it was contagious and several were just showing up and the rest had to carry the load.

Interesting symbolism that Mark wasn't interested in keeping it and gave it to Petey, just like how he isn't interested in reintegrating. Ricken's red book also gets introduced to the blue innie world, so I feel like Ricken represents the outside world spilling into the inside world.

Oh, and there's also the red candle being introduced by Harmony. Guessing by her name, she might also have a role in reintegrating. (She also brought in Ricken's book).
Definitely will keep an eye out for characters and symbols with red now.

* Helly’s last words to Dylan were, “see you soon.”

* There’s a hierarchy implied in the way characters address one another - Ms Cobel, Mr Milchick, Ms Kasey, Mr Graner vs Mark, Dylan, Helly, Irv, Burt. 

* After threatening to cut off her fingers, innie Helly heads up in the elevator with her video disc and then returns immediately, from her perspective, with outie Helly’s disc. This is expected. But everyone from MDR and management are waiting outside the elevator exactly as she left them. Even if she was only gone five minutes, this seems unlikely.

* Mark still has a backup copy of the map at the abandoned greenhouse.

* The implication of the first edition passage that Burt quoted is that the current handbook has been changed and likely perverted for ulterior motives over time (by subsequent CEOs?).",5,1646636600,146
hzokrch,4,hawkeyetlse,"&gt; But everyone from MDR and management are waiting outside the elevator exactly as she left them. Even if she was only gone five minutes, this seems unlikely.

Yes, it was done for effect. According to the clock it was about an hour and a half. It's reasonable to assume that Milchick immediately went upstairs to handle outie Helly, and we know that outie Helly spoke with Cobel before making her recording. So they weren't all just standing there in the basement the whole time. They reassembled in front of the elevator to see Helly come back down (although it's a stretch to have us believe that they would all be standing in the exact same positions as earlier). Like I said, it was done for effect, to show how innie Helly must feel to think she's escaping, only to end up right back in the same situation a moment later.

&gt; Mark still has a backup copy of the map at the abandoned greenhouse.

Petey was also working on another copy in Mark's basement when Cobel broke in. I don't know if they showed what happened to it (if it's still somewhere in the basement or if Petey took it with him when he walked to the gas station). Anyway the show seems to be indicating to us (by having innie Mark destroy the original map) that the actual details of the map are not what's important. Its purpose was to make the MDR employees curious about what might be going on elsewhere in the basement (are there people living in houses, etc.)

&gt; The implication of the first edition passage that Burt quoted is that the current handbook has been changed and likely perverted for ulterior motives over time (by subsequent CEOs?)

I don't think necessarily ""perverted"" since it's normal that the handbook would have to be updated periodically for modern tech: computers and group photos and coffee machines and elevators and code detectors, and severance itself.

The symbolism is uncanny, Kier looks very much like Lenin. The way its subjects are purposely being kept in the dark, being fed propaganda, the leaders words being treated as religious gospel, which substitute for actual religion, the way everyone slaves and toils away for meager rewards (waffle party being the utmost prize), deluding themselves their work is noble and will bring prestige to the company.

And now that book by Mark's brother in-law accidentally surfaced into this immaculate, seemingly impenetrable environment, which will challenge the dogma, the same way people from the communist eastern block were trying to tune to western radio frequencies and hear outside information that would present a completely different reality than what they were being fed by the regime.

Now, communist metaphor aside, the actual work they do, looking at ""scary numbers"", seems like a crock of shit. My gut feeling is the work this company does is actually observing the employees themselves, they look like guinea pigs in a social experiment, to see how far you can indoctrinate someone in a closed system.

In the initial experiment, his team had subjects read short stories from various genres. One group simply read a story and rated how much they liked it at the end. The other group did the same, but the researchers spoiled the narrative, as if by accident, by giving them a short introduction.

“’In this, the classic story in which the woman murders her husband with a frozen leg of lamb…,’” said Christenfeld nonchalantly as an example.

“What we found, remarkably, was if you spoil stories they actually enjoy them more.”

Christenfeld repeated the experiment with three different genres: mystery stories containing a “whodunit” moment; ironic twist stories, where a surprise ending crystallizes the whole story; and literary fiction with a neat resolution.

“Across all three genres spoilers actually were enhancers,” said Christenfeld. “The term is wrong.”",2,1646978590,138
i07kdkj,4,Immortal385,"Spoilers, despite their name, seem to increase enjoyment of stories. This could be because readers enjoy reading expected endings, because knowing the ending allows them to appreciate aesthetic elements instead of guessing what will happen, or because knowing the ending increases fluency by enabling readers to correctly interpret clues and events. We conducted three experiments to test these hypotheses. Experiment 1 collected ratings at the midpoints of anthologized stories, and determined that readers experience greater pleasure even before reading the end of spoiled stories. This spoiler benefit was mediated by processing fluency, and not by appreciation of aesthetic elements. Experiment 2 found that spoilers similar to those in Experiment 1 do not increase ease of reading — or pleasure — for very-easy-to-read stories. Experiment 3 found, however, that very simple spoilers could increase the pleasure of easy-to-read stories.

Also, I'm pretty sure there are four box's they put the numbers into so maybe the team there is trying to recreate one of the founders of Lumon and they do that by somehow taking memories or experiences they have and sorting them into one of the 4 boxes in a precise way that will allow some other department too turn that into consciousness of some kind.

They’re definitely prisoners and there’s multiple departments, “experiments” and they use tribalism to keep them apart, had Milcheck not run the 266 nothing would have happened.

The goats are definitely another department.

I think marks group is getting experimented on emotional control.

The goat group(?) is getting experimented on inter species bonding.

O &amp; D is getting experimented on reactions to art.

They’re all prisoners so like someone said it’s reminscitent of the Stamford experiment, but it also has aspects of the Miligram experiment with seeing how Mark will do what he’s told or whether he’d do something else.

The concept of keeping an employee as a prisoner is very much reminiscent of early America and modern America through the 14th amendment and modern collection of capital at the top thanks to industr(ial revolution)y.

**What we know:**

* There are goats (or were they lambs?) being raised on the severed floor.
* Lumon higher ups are HAPPY about reintegration being possible
* Deception to keep individual employees apart is common place
* The woman at the maternity facility is important in some way, and is either rich or being put there by a rich person/organization. 
* The employees are prisoners according to Harmony, and Kier has a quote regarding prisoners
   * This may lend credence to the theory that MDR's job is related to creating the perfect slave.

**What we might infer:**

* Lumon is raising goats/lambs to slaughter?
* Lumon intentionally places, or possibly implants, conspiracies about the other departments to keep people apart
   * Why have them on the same floor at all, though? Is it an experiment?
* Burt was experiencing a similar event to Irving while in the conference room

**What I think:**

* The woman at the maternity facility is either:
   * An Eagan
   * The woman from the news who got pregnant while severed.
* The excitement related to reintegration has something to do with bringing Kier back to life",40,1646969449,248

So the transition process might have been turned off deliberately (again, by Graner?) so that she would still be in outie form when he retrieved her from the elevator.  And they were able to get her from the severed floor to the outside world without her going through the transition again, so some entrances/exits must not be wired for the transition (or they can turn it off when needed).

i0862xt,5,lonelygagger,"This show, man. A riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. As expected, Helly didn't die but seems destined to remain trapped there forever. I feel like her innie is going wage war on her outie, and vice versa. The outie must have some reason for sending her back in every time despite the horrifying conditions that would have caused her to go to such drastic measures. She *must* know what's going on not to question it.

The biggest new mystery of this episode were the goats. ""They're not ready yet. It isn't time."" Are they breeding/cloning them to maturity? For what conceivable purpose? Others have pointed out that baby goats are called kids, which coincidentally lines up with Devon giving birth this episode (which we never actually see). All of these things give me shades of ""Lost"" and I can't help but wonder if some of them are red herrings meant to throw us off the path.

Cobel refers to ""running a 266"" on Irving. Is that what the swapped paintings were, to foster distrust between different departments? I found it interesting that Ms. Casey told Irving that Burt was in the conference room after that. Is she working for or against them? Also, Mark made passing reference to Helly looking at ""happy numbers"" for awhile, and I thought that was interesting that they could designate one or the other.

There's so much going on in this show that I feel like I need to watch it again just to catch everything.

i08e14y,5,drawing-maker,"Gosh I'm just right there with you all trying to crack the mystery of this show. I wanted to lay out some the themes:

* Corporate Imperialism: all their stuff is Lumon brand, they're shoving office culture down our throats; they have corporate housing. Also the sort of idealization of Egan family is very walmarty you know? This has something to do with late stage capitalism for sure.
* Biblical allusions: Helly; goats; biblical feeling paintings; godliness of kier egan (irving told someone to say ""egan"" instead of ""jesus""). I think this speaks to some kind of apocalyptic vibes. Like the end is nigh.
* Consciousness: Lots of references to the ""mind"" - on the map; in ricken's book. Could be the whole company is a ""mind""; they are definitely dealing with some subconscious stuff. 
* Intergenerational legacy: well we have the egans, the pregnancies, the doula, etc. 
* Slavery: I mean this one is obvious.

Things that come up a lot as theories that I'm not convinced are overall themes:

* Resources / Resource extractions: people were sort of obsessed with water at the beginning in this sub, due to the water droplet logo and said the filenames are named after bodies of water. But they are also named after american cities, so I think this was a bit of a stretch. I dunno I think water may still have some component, but not a core theme necessarily.
* Children: people think children are being severed or that's why the goats were in there, and we've got the pregnant sister and there's a reference to a severed employee who was pregnant. But I don't think this is an overall theme actually mainly because there literally isn't a child in the show yet as a character. I think this has more to do with family legacy than the vulnerability of children.",21,1647001758,311

i08egmz,5,Valeand,"I’m pretty sure this episode gave the clearest clues as to what’s going on. First of all the lines from Rickens book about the difference between machines and humans, the emphasis on skin and body. Secondly the O&amp;D “jokes” about larvas in a pouch taking over MDRs bodies.

The severed are not second versions of the outies with different biographical memories, they are brand new conscious AIs that are “initialised” with the personalities, non-autobiographical memories and skills of real people but their own new memory compartment.

The numbers? They’re auditing their own code, that’s why they feel something, it’s literally their own mind. They are removing the humours deemed harmful by Kier.

When they go down the elevator, they don’t just switch memories, the AI just straight up takes over.

And reintegration is just actual integration of the AI into the human, that’s why it’s such a big deal.

The departments also make sense then: what are important milestones for AI to achieve that we haven’t yet? Improving itself (MDR), being creative (O&amp;D), potentially caring for humans (the goats)...",43,1647002024,179
i08epzc,5,Background-Skin-6890,"I thought it was an interesting callback to the painting that Burt and irv initially bond over outside the wellness center. One of the figures was a goat. At the time I thought it an anthropomorphic idea of ""dread"" and assumed that each of the figures represented one of the four tempers. I also feel like that is the cave that kier says he went to in his mind and conquered. So he conquers his four tempers, but one of them is more animal than rational/more instinct and intuitive than logical is my thinking here. It gives credence to the idea that Mark and Petey have been running around together based on just ""gut instinct"" since there is no rational reason for them to suspect lumon is more sinister than first revealed. I like the idea of the goat being dread because I think that is what Helly is out of the department. She is the emotional, the animal so to speak. She hears what sounds like a baby in the break room and then we hear the weird baby like cries of the goat leading her to the room. I like the idea of this being ""lambs led to slaughter."" it would be cool to see if helly and mark are punished for being led to the room and their memories are ""slaughtered"" of it? I do also like how this all ties into more animal characteristics tied to other characters this episode. With O and D saying that MDR has larvae that eat themselves to remain young it calls to mind Irvs comment ""Hi kids, what's for dinner."" Double entendre here since if they were once larvae the dinner would be themselves, or if he is references the goats he could be talking to the department as sacrificial themselves. Like if they are all the kids who ""aren't ready yet"" because they haven't completely finished refining themselves.

As a thought experiment, say that you had a computer powerful enough to perfectly simulate someone’s brain. It would simulate every neuron and action potential and every input (sensations, chemicals from the rest of the “body,” etc.) such that the simulated brain is, from its perspective, living as a real human. Would you consider that brain to be conscious, even though it’s a machine? How do you know you’re not a brain in a vat?

Ironically, I think the second half of the quote is a lot deeper than the first. Maybe the only difference between man and a sufficiently-advanced machine is the fact that we’re made of flesh and they aren’t. Of course, the whole quote is presented as humor in the show, but that doesn’t mean it can’t also be the subject of analysis.

On the topic of man vs. machine, I suspect there will be some element of androids or AI at some point. Maybe even the Severance chip is running an AI that interfaces with the host’s brain. That would also explain the proximity limits as the chip would need to be a certain distance away from the main computer. Also it explains why they referred to the removed chip as “That’s Petey.” Finally, it would explain why Outie Helly told Innie Helly that she’s not a real person; maybe she literally isn’t.",4,1647007366,261

i08rl0c,5,Deferential_dreams,"&gt;	Well I am a black woman in the US &amp; I am more likely to die in a hospital during childbirth than I am at home because of the very medical professionals who are supposed to protect &amp; help me in that moment.

I’m sorry, but you really need to source this.

I was able to find data regarding the maternal mortality rate of black women compared to white women in the US (it’s about 2.5-3.5x higher, depending on which study you look at). While the racial disparity in treatment by medical professionals is well documented and can’t be overstated, there are also other factors to consider, such as the higher rates of hypertension and obesity among African American women, which could also contribute to higher maternal mortality rates.

I couldn’t find good data on whether planned hospital births are safer than planned at-home births. There appear to be some positives for either scenario; however, at-home births are associated with double the risk of perinatal death and a threefold increase in risk of serious neurological dysfunction, see [here](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/04/planned-home-birth).

Again, I spent about 15 minutes doing a quick research on this, but I couldn’t find anything to conclusively show that black women have better outcomes at home compared to a hospital birth. Each individual should educate themselves and make an informed decision on where and how to give birth, but you should be cautious that you aren’t stating your own opinions as facts.

(Edit: Also, please don’t take this the wrong way, but the maternal mortality rate among black women in the US, although higher than that of white women, is 0.04%. While ideally that number would be 0%, your odds of dying during pregnancy as a black woman are lower than your odds of dying from the flu.

Also, most of the disparity is caused by cardiomyopathy and other blood pressure disorders, see [here](https://www.prb.org/resources/black-women-over-three-times-more-likely-to-die-in-pregnancy-postpartum-than-white-women-new-research-finds/). While systemic racism is undeniably the primary or sole factor that causes the racial disparity in blood pressure and obesity, it’s hard to attribute this specific difference in maternal mortality to racist healthcare providers.)",7,1647008786,349

You obviously 'resign' from a job, but the word has another meaning - to resign yourself/oneself - to accept that something undesirable cannot be avoided, to surrender oneself to another's guidance, to make yourself accept something that you do not like because you cannot change it.

&amp;#x200B;

i08tsl4,5,twangman88,"For me the biggest evidence is the intro. There are lots and lots of Mark Scouts but only a single Mark S in his pjs with a lumon badge. So this gives me a few thoughts. 

1) the innies are essentially the individuals ‘soul’

2) it’s possible that the outies aren’t human bodies. Maybe they are 3D printed androids and the lumon ‘soul’ innie gets put into a different shell all the time. 

3) sleep is integral to whatever is happening. They fuse together on the bed and it must be significant that the lumon badge wearing ‘innie’ is in PJs

4) the black sludge is only ever acknowledged/interacted with by the innie the outie figures seem to be completely oblivious. 

Not related to the intro but we’ve seen outtie Mark forget quite a few things about his personal life. He forgot about the non dinner-dinner and he forgot the the woman he went on a date with was his sisters midwife and would therefore obviously be at the birthing suite. I believe memories are processed in the brain while you’re sleeping. But what if you sleep cycle has been hijacked for a nefarious actor for a sinister purpose?

If this is the case, their actual brain would in fact be ‘turned off’/asleep while at Lumon but I don’t think that it would matter to the plot if this is the technical way Lumon/severance works, if you get my drift.

Mark forgetting stuff I think could be a similar theory to the above where the work is them deleting their outtie memories to the point they become the perfect worker and don’t ever leave. This also tracks with a remark Petey made that there are departments where the workers don’t leave.

I want to see scenes with Helly's outie.

A stupid goat room? Sigh. They gonna go down that road and show just random nonse scenes? The ""war"" feels like same kind of nonse. Both just waste of time. More scenes with Helly and the shrink would've been better.

First time we've seen CCTVs. I was thinking they didn't have any. Though I guess it explains some things as they're not actively monitored it seems.

For example, giving birth in cabins even if you are rich rather than going to an expensive hospital doesn't make sense. The butler or whoever he is didn't even react and let a stranger in.

There are goats. Experiments. Execs that don't talk. They monitor everything and everyone. There are lot of lies and nothing is as it seems.

It's kind of a human body. The internal working of the human body is separate from the mind. And then when you go to sleep, you let your subconscious mind. There are three separate intelligences at work.

There is the executive department as the internal mind of the body which reacts to the decisions of the conscious or subconscious minds. Sub and normal conscious is separated by sleep.

There is a huge vault of ancestral stuff just preserved. Like the DNA. 

Head of O&amp;D knows a lot of stuff. I mean lot. It seems like the eyes and creative half of the brain. Which seems to be deciding at his own. MDR might be the logical half of the brain. However MDR might be cut of from memories, literally.

I’ll have to rewatch and look more at Harmony and Milchiks dynamic. It seemed both were a little wary of each other this episode. I feel like one is a die hard company loyalist and the other is working against the company, which I’d guess is Harmony because of her issues with the Board? 

For some reason when they showed the rich pregnant lady I immediately thought she was connected to Dylan somehow, because of his break room crying baby reference. 

So glad to see more of Ms Casey, she seems different though outside of her office/therapy room place. She seemed kind of afraid and unsure of herself. 

Loved the scene with Irv and Burt, I could honestly watch the two of them interact all day it’s so heartwarming.

An interesting fact about the Devil Tarot trump is that it features two “people” who are chained to a stone on which the devil sits. However, if you look closely, the chains are loosely placed around their necks, and they could remove them at any time—their bondage is only illusory, the result of the inversion of their perception.

Well, when Mark takes her to the stair case he stays around the corner and tells her he can't watch her leave and I've been trying to figure out why he couldn't watch.

Those chips in their brains are AI, and they just need BODIES to be in. They wont work without the human element so, severance is the way. the whole office is a learning environment for the AI to live and grow. They have lots of support programs, securities,debugging programs, firewalss, and tasks to help guide them to learn but they're not learning the way LUMON would like them to. They're learning the HUMAN way, by reaching out and forming bonds and relationships, falling in love etc. 
It's all AI and its brand new that LUMON are working on. 
""Trying something new with Casey""
""Taking heart to a colleague"" 
""Running a 288 or whatever on helly"" 
""You are NOT a person""
Casey, in her own element is INTIMIDATING. But outside of her space. She walks clumsy like a child, is slow and short and acts only on emotion, like a child. Shes a BRAND new program that's learning how to BE supportive and cohesive in this environment. 
Same for O&amp;D, they pit them against each other with these outlandish stories that they BELEIVE so that they're afraid. Fear Keeps you safe, its instinctive, and is apparently trying to be taught. To these AI with all seemingly basic and mundane tasks.to be ""Productive""which may ultimately be something more sinister. or it could be some billionaires Bitcoin farm. 🤷‍♂️

He probably knows too much even if he doesn’t realize it, hence the black goo visions and inter-departmental relations. Gah, this show does my brain in but I love it! I have questions and theories after every episode but I don’t feel like I’m being thrown around with the plot.

More specifically, I was thinking about how the outies are the ones who do the sleeping, and what would drive someone to be okay with giving up two thirds of their lives. Let’s say, Monday through Friday, you spend eight hours a day working and seven or eight hours sleeping. That’s only eight or nine hours each day you need to spend consciously existing — and we already know that Mark spends that time getting absolutely blotto drunk. He doesn’t want to exist at all, and this is the closest he can get.

I think the only reason he’s kept himself alive at all is because of his sister — we know that they’re close, and that they’re the only family they have left. (I also think that’s why she tried so hard to make sure he’s included in things like the dinner party and her birth, and pushes him to go on that date. They both know she’s the only thing keeping him from ending it.)",6,1647072424,176

Harmony said she's trying something different with Ms Casey. Going along with the AI development theory of Lumon (AI chip implanted in human body for half of its waking life)---Ms Casey had been given more freedom/allowed more ""noise"" in her programming which is why she tells Irving about Burt in the conference room (she wouldn't approve of interdepartmental engagement if she was acting in alignment with Lumon procedural protocols).

I think it’s unlikely that he would read the book in the conference room in full view of anyone who could be passing by and even less likely that he would just drop it on a chair and then leave it there, given what a major contraband any book would be. It is far more likely that he was told to read it openly and then leave it behind. At no pint has he been called out for allowing the book to be found, so obviously Coble is ok with it being out there and circulating.

i0gl0fk,5,agonypants,"Man, you are spot on.  I'm actually pretty nervous about the prospect of a second season.  The problem with most broadcast TV series is that the writers drag the ""mysteries"" out and invent new, shoddy ones just to keep the series going.  And since the networks usually decide when a series is canceled, the shows tend to end too hastily or sloppily.

I prefer self-contained series that have well thought out plot structures - including proper endings.  There are couple of possible outcomes that could really sour my opinion of the show:

* They don't address the mysteries of this season: They leave the audience hanging for ""answers"" that never come.  The writers just continually invent poorly thought out plots with no planned ending in sight.  An ending eventually arrives, but it's literally just thrown together at the last moment.
* They do address the mysteries of the season: But then go on to invent new, sub-par mysteries for the following seasons.  Once the mystery of this season is gone, it's difficult to see how they're going to maintain audience interest for subsequent seasons.

They can't simply tell another story within the MDR department.  Once we know what goes on there, the magic of this season will be gone.  The best way forward for a following season would be to create another self-contained story with new characters, within this universe, but not in the MDR department.",2,1647149423,236

Irvs hallucinations are because he's spending more time away from his computer talking to Burt and spending less time correcting his numbers. This happened to Petey spending too much time exploring hallways etc. They need to keep departments at a distance (long hallways, art experiments, deliberately causing distrust etc) so that the numbers department stays on task. Plus when groups band together it leads to mutinies / uprisings etc. Harmony isn't aware of the departments actual purpose and the board wants to prevent her from digging too deeply into how reintegration is possible. Lumen design some kind of AI or brainwashing chip that they use to control people in positions of power.

1. introduce the other pregnant lady and that she may be connected to Lumen
2. and show that outie-Mark is starting to wonder

it could have been done in half that time, leaving more time for the corridor scenes with Mark/Helly, which had so much potential but got interrupted by ""some goats"" (good luck coming with a satisfying explanation about that one -- goats in a farm area of the complex, why not; goats among desk areas, that does not make sense, even in a surreal environment like the SVR floor).

In Ep 4, we were shown that sensory triggers can lead one persona to leak into the other one, re: Mark's tree sculpture. That is, severance is not air-tight as Lumen may have presumed. During the retreat scene, Ricken talks about his disappointment that Mark did not call back about his book, that it was an advanced copy, etc. All those sentences laying out the groundwork for Mark to talk and subconsciously say something about the book, giving a hint to Ricken that innie-Mark had read the book. That did not happen, I found it to be a let-down and wondered what was the point of this idle, useless chit-chat between Ricken and Mark. Character development? Sure, maybe, but what about priorities? The episode was 45 min instead of the expected hour long, and there is SO MUCH to answer.

Helly rarely clocks in actual work on her machine. And she's struggling to conform/adapt. It's as if the process is reliant on having the severed people fine-tune and ""reprogram"" themselves from the terminals. Though it doesn't explain how other departments don't go through this process. So, it could simply be that the 4 of them are ultimately recalibrating everyone's neural implants across the whole floor.

In a sense, they couldn't just rely on an AI to do it. Probably because there is still an element of humanity they don't understand. So they rely on actual humans to do it for them, but through this abstracted interface of ""weird numbers"".",2,1647542849,155

Through that lens, Marks moment of instrospection on the dock symbolizes, both for his innie and outie, a transformation. His innie is conflicted by Helly’s return as it’s clear she doesn’t want to be there, but has up until now been a rule-abiding worker, only challenging authority within the rules of the system. After this moment, he makes the decision to pursue the trail that Petey left for him; attempting to recreate the map of the severed floor and enlists Helly to work with him. It could be argued that Ricken’s quote “a good person will follow the rules, a great person will follow himself” foreshadow this later in the episode.

For his outie, Mark has breached his silence of his experience with Petey by sharing the beginning of the story with his sister. It’s possible that the imagery of the vibrating phone foreshadows his willingness to answer the (literal) call to adventure.",2,1647556939,200

&gt;!If the board truly believes that reintegration (or ""un-severing"") isn't possible, then it's because the brain is never truly partitioned by the severance procedure. The chip is the media containing the innie's memories, as an artificial hippocampus, which arguably makes it easier to have the innies emerge with a pre-installed set of memories.!&lt;

&gt;!In this case, the damage done by the reintegration hack makes more sense, because it enables both the natural hippocampus and the severance chip to be active at the same time. It's a merger of two personas into one. Not a reintegration, but forced integration.!&lt;

&gt;!Another piece of evidence is that I recall Harmony and co. referring to the extracted chip itself as Petey.!&lt;

&gt;!The simplest test to this theory would be removing the chip from a living severed employee's brain. If only the outie stays in the body after that, then the innie has to be stored in the chip.!&lt;

7. Maybe I’ll be Mark next week and forever beyond that… 
8. “Baby goats” 😋 I’m going to use that
9. “That’s poetic as shit, man.” Synergies.
10. Long live free-range chickens
11. Mark passes on more Merlot and opts for water
12. Mark cleared a hurdle talking about Gemma and “the procedure”
13. Harmony is everywhere, is a privilege, and is soothing
14. Dylan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! His innie has some Helly symptoms… just not the full blown “fuck this shit” disease - but def close
15. F*ck you Lumen - you take people from their loved ones - just write what you know

Lines up with burt/irv knowing each other outside and that he's been there the longest, would have needed his memories purged more often. 

Might be a little late in the season to introduce a false memory concept but black goo is still unexplained and it'd tie nicely into the mysteries around irv and the intro of the goo seeping out of a recycling bin and becoming a shadow of Mark.

1) The goal for severance is military application. This clicked for me during the Dylan at home scene. Dylan pocketed a card from O&amp;D that was showing hand to hand combat. Why would Milcheck take the risk of waking Dylan up at home if that wasn't a MASSIVE security risk? Seeing that and realizing that the chips are not location based and can be turned off and on remotely points to use for soldiers. Plus there was this line from Petey ""What if you were killing people for eight hours a day and you didn't know it?"" I think this is why we're seeing politicians involved in the plot too. And wow I don't know how Dylan is going to handle knowing that he has a kid, and knowing he'll never see him again.

2) Maintenance was moving the doorways to make it harder to map the floor. 

3) Why was O&amp;D handling hatchets? And then a watering can?

Milchick must have been desperate to get that card back, even though we already know they can't smuggle anything out of Lumon. Nor does the info on the card make any sense.

Lots of goat talk this episode is encouraging that we might get answers about that eventually.

Harmony is getting more and more eccentric. Her outburst at Mark, singing the Lumon song, praying to the Lumon shrine in her house and then going to Devon's in that weird outfit. What's she up to?

I'm in the UK and I woke this morning at about 4am. I couldn't get back to sleep, so I thought I'd check if the new episode was live. It was, so I thought I'd watch it then go back to sleep after that. Despite being really tired, it completely held my interest and I didn't nod off once.

Mark and Helly clearly have some chemistry going so it stands to reason perhaps Mark and Casey had the same chemistry. 

This would’ve been enough to make me suspicious on my own but when they pass by each other on the way to the break room they share a somewhat intimate moment. So it seems like there is maybe something more to their history then just a distant working relationship. 

Harmony also refers to her as a ‘part time innie’ which just feels… odd as well. 

Add to all that the fact that we have very pointedly NOT seen any pictures or flashbacks of Gemma despite Mark doing a lot of introspection and reflecting on her, which leads me to believe she’s a character that we’ve already met somehow and Ms Casey seems like the obvious candidate.

Peteys chip is actually her husbands “mind”. She can successfully implant it in someone else’s body. But her chip husband doesn’t remember her. That’s why she’s testing Ms Casey to see if feelings can pass on from a body to a chip or from a chip to a body. That would give Cobel her husband back.

\- Dylan's outie. I know it was heartbreaking to some, but I am glad that outie Dylan seems to be a good man. And this info will give innie Dylan a reason to fight

\- Fun with Grenier and Cobel: Grenier is bantering with Cobel IMO

\- Cobel is a monster, but in a way we see she is just a very lonely person that was probably induced into the cult as a child herself

\- Concert scene: ""F Lumon!""

\- Mark S in rebellion mode getting all the ladies

They can awaken Innies remotely. When I first saw that I thought of the phone Petey had and wondered if someone was trying to call him to remote activate him, but the end of the episode lead somewhere else.

The other pregnant woman is severed and her innie is the one that has to deal with the effects of pregnancy. Her husband is a politician advocating for Severance.

We got a time reference from 2 years ago that matches up with Mark's wife death. The news article also referenced a start of something 2 years ago. I think this matches up with the severed floor ""experiment"". I think the reason Harmony is so involved with Mark is because she has something to do with Mark's wife death. She is monitoring Mark for his effects of dealing with death as an Outie and as an Innie; which is why she uses his wife's candle, is getting close to Mark's sister. 

Milchick kind of soft confirms that it is possible to smuggle out information from a severed floor. He was desperate enough to search Dylan's home and awaken him at home.

My thought with the black goo hallucinations that Irv is experiencing is that they are either something that any long term severed employee would experience, a side effect of gen-1 severing, or a sign that he was mentally tampered with more than once. When you combine that with the suspicion that Helly is either an Eagan or a Lumon exec, they may be more hesitant to mess with her brain beyond the initial sever and that's why things are getting so out of control - if a regular employee was acting out like her they would have nipped it in the bud, but they can't with her out of fear of causing brain damage.",27,1647622089,168

**Alexa**

* Both of their dates coincide with Mark's Break Room work injuries.
   * She lets Mark take the lead in responses to outside public opposition gatherings they 'happen upon' just before parting ways for the evening.
* She could easily assist in a severance implant into a newborn's small, soft cranium under the guise of Devon's midwife.
   * Notice how both Devon's and the senator's newborn heads are always covered.
   * Both infants were born within hours of each other in separate suites of the same birthing center.

**Rick**

* He made such a show Devon assisting him to secretly gift an advanced copy of his latest book right after Mark left for work, which Harmony immediately confiscated when they drove off.
   * He only asks Outie Mark's thoughts on it out of Devon's earshot, using her impending labor to deflect confusion over its existence.
   * This is days after at least 8 Lumon employees know/read it - Harmony, Milchick, Burt, Felicia and the entire Innie MDR team.
* Hanging kelp and other dietary/medicinal 'herbs' are likely the cause of Devon's lactation problems.
* Notice the kid goat's head next to the baby bassinet when Harmony arrived?
* He and Harmony feigned ignorance of each other when she's introduced to Devon beyond Outie Mark's supposed recommendation.

i174myg,6,DM_ME_DOPAMINE,"This an the part I don’t have nailed down yet. I firmly suspect a coup brought down by Kier descendants who are wholly devout to him, namely Cobel,  whose devoutness to Kier shows in her little ritual at home. She recites the same 9 words Myrtle did until she fell asleep as her father used to make her, and also stares in a trance like state at Kier Eagans photo on her desk. Myrtle said she’d be the first woman CEO. Next in line of siblings was likely Ambrose, 2nd verse of poem, rhymes it with “ban those.”

“Ban those” descending of Kier through Imogen from running stuff/whatever weird shit the Eagans were doing.  Irving didn’t seem to care of any prior Egan CEOs aside from Jane, current, and Kier. Then Dylan retorts that “he’s been reversed as fuck until this point” after I’ve snipes at him for being disrespectful in Kiers “home.”  Refers to Lumon as a “she.”  

I literally have two giant white boards drawn out with crazy connective lines a la the IASIP Charlie meme, and I can go much deeper.  Have to work out what got added this week, but I would not be remotely surprised if Cobel is leading a Imogen bloodline coup against the rest of the Lumon family, end game of taking over? Punishing the others? There’s a clear line between early Kier and what gets thrown around how. She’s the religious zealot coming to see her fathers vision though in its purest form. Hence Irving over the top reverence for Kier, and his relationship with Burt who brings up early Kier and marvels at the art and it’s early meaning.

Petey was someone important to Cobel. She integrated his chip, was tragic when he passed away.  That’s why she needed his chip.  A family member was in there. “We rekindling the fire quickly with our nimble new performer!” after Petey was “no longer with this company,” aka with his family members she’s trying to reintegrate and join the coup.

Mark remembered nothing of Peteys going ons before he left, even though petey stressed that Mark tried the same actions to leave lumon as he did.  He said he has been integrated for 2 weeks and was mapping the place, but we don’t know for how long integrated Petey was still going to Lumon before their outside encounter. Shit, Mark may have broken him out of the place and it been a whole ordeal, only to not remember the next day and just being told Petey was “no longer with the company” aka became a dead Kier. 

My bet is system maintenance resets the relationships between O&amp;D/interdepartmental shit going on, Dylan forgets the traumatic Milcheck home visit and seeing his son,  and other “unpleasant” things they want gone. 

Helly was the voice that was calling the cell phone. I have an insane ear for voices, can pick out all 400 Alison Brie characters on bojack no matter how much she throws her speaking. If you don’t believe that, it’s in the first line.

Who’s on the table now, mark?

So wondering what all will be covered in said maintenance and if it will affect those memories/knowledge. I suspect inside Helly is some relative Helena who they’re trying to parse the macro data out of so she can go on to whatever they do with Kier souls after goats start em up. Whether she a rogue Cobel type, or a respected by the board Kier, Cobel is “supposed” to be preparing them for whatever it is, but is actually planning a coup form the inside and the board has no clue that she, milchick, Burt, and Irving are integrated family members or allies planning the overthrow the later Kier descendants after whatever duel  and family fallout, and the “ban those” line from Irving’s 2nd verse of the mnemonic poem of CEOs following Ambrose, who I suspect is Irving himself.",7,1647635682,333

So, it occurred to me how they could 'erase' specific memories \*within the limitations of what we already know about how severance works:\*  they could re-sever Dylan a new tiny partition that only contains that one memory of his outie's closet and meeting the kid.  They can't do this too often, because you'd run out of brain (or maybe it's bad to sever a person into too many pieces, or something.)

The penis was subsequently surgically reattached. Lorena claimed that her husband had raped and abused her for years; John was charged with rape later that year, but was acquitted.

i1c2he2,6,GeekShuttle,"Apologies if this theory has been discussed before- - I'm new to the forum - but having loved this show over the past six episodes I really wanted to join the discussion.

I think this episode help solidify a working theory I have that Lumen built an artificial society, and that even the severed Outie home lives are a part of Lumen. Those homes on the map Petey made have to be Mark's neighborhood, and it seems like Optics and Design are creating objects for the Outie world (almost like a Truman Show type thing). Thus, severance is used as a way to experiment on the Outie society, rather than the Innies being the subjects. This also means the code has to do with something regarding either regulating Outies, and perhaps the emotional responses are due to the Innies coming into contact with their Outies or people or events they are familiar with in the Outie world. I wouldn't be surprised if, for example, Alexa works somewhere within Lumen, or if there is severance between the real world and the Outie world.

I also think this is why the senator's wife is acting cold and distant to Devon, though I haven't quite connected those dots yet. Either Devon is also a part of the artificial society and the wife knows it and is instructed not to mingle with them, or they both are, or the wife is some sort of Stepford wife type deal that the senator has been 'rewarded' with for backing Lumen.

I also think there are multiple layers here if this is true; as in, the purpose of the Outie society also being Lumen is a result of something else, such as some sort of dystopic event. Maybe we're even talking about some sort of Matrix situation here by the end.",3,1647728795,304

I just finished rewatching all of the episodes and I’m pretty sure Dylan and Milchick are a couple.  Why else would he say “are we good?” when he switched back to his outtie?  He’d be like “who the fuck are you and what are you doing in my house?”.  Also the kid wasn’t afraid of Milchick and it would kind of explain (still not cool) why milchick  was so stern with the son.

i1catye,6,Dox_au,"I'm starting to feel like the entire objectives of these ""departments"" are literally just human trials for Lumon to work out the kinks in order to get Severance legalised nationally.

For MDR, it would appear that the severed employees are being shown numbers relevant to their outtie life. Could be kids birthdays, the date their spouse died, their own phone number, etc. The innie's clearly recognise these numbers and they have emotions attached to them - but they don't know why. They categorise the numbers by emotional response and Lumon uses that data to fine-tune the chip. If MDR ever reaches a point where none of the numbers have any emotional response at all, then they've succeeded in completely eliminating outside influences from the severed employee.

For O&amp;D, I suspect it's a similar arrangement, but instead of numbers, they're 3D printing items from their outtie lives. Everything from trivial household items they have sitting around at home, to objects that may be linked to a traumatic event. 

Mark's Wellness session echoed this. Seeing him construct a tree would be a huge blow for Lumon, because it's clear that some level of his subconscious is still aware.

&amp;#x200B;

So my theory is that the ""work"" each department conducts is not actually ""important"", it's entirely irrelevant. The work doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is how the employees respond to it.",22,1647732641,230
i1cd69k,6,Largue,The way that scene was shot made me think he got it from trying to break open a door. Maybe he couldn’t handle being trapped in the break room.,1,1647733767,29
i1ce3pr,6,SalSevenSix,I double checked and they are different visits..1st visit was just Irv and Dylan after they talked with Burt in the hallway. 2nd visit was all MDR staff after Mark decided to go.,1,1647734216,33
i1cgwy7,6,nem0nic,"Just watched E06 and there's a LOT to unpack here.

I think Cobel, like all the severed characters, has great tragedy in their life, and Lumon and it's underlying philosophy gives them some kind of deep comfort.  While I don't think she (or the rest of the upper management characters shown so far) are actually severed, they buy into that philosophy so much that they're willing to do horrible things to preserve it.  Cobel's own tragedy is that she is an orphan, who also seems to have suffered through some kind of other illness that required hospitalization or even committal.  I'm sure Milchick's story is very similar.

I also think that Lumon ""technology"" is very real.  Even if you think that bracelet in the shrine is her ""baby bracelet"", that puts Cobel in her 70s.  I think it's from some later event, and she was an early teen when she got it - making her even older.  She looks pretty good for 70+, right?  I'm making an assumption that the outtie world is modern times because Mark's phone in the band scene looks like a modern Nokia (line of cameras on the back top middle), putting the year sometime after 2017.

It's pretty clear that even for the people who buy into the company philosophy, everyone has a favorite - either Kier or Eagan.  Is this what the uprising was about?  Has Lumon broken down into 2 militant camps?  Those cards Dylan found in O&amp;D look like melee attacks.  And hatchets?  It also seems like each philosophy has some major differences.  What if one side believes in severance and one doesn't, and that's driving a wedge between them?  If so, can we also assume because of the 2 alternate versions of the coup painting that there is a single person or group controlling it all?

Also, about the card Dylan stole.  It never left the severed floor.  I think Milchick was talking to Graner (who was controlling the switch).  Dylan told Milchick that the card was in the second stall - and home bathrooms don't have stalls.  I think he's referring to the bathroom in MDR.  I don't think the scanner in the elevator is fake - we've seen it work for both written words (the ""I QUIT"" post-it) and the map.  But maybe some kind of programming as a part of the severance process makes the severed **think** some of this Lumon magic is real.  

Also, we learn something interesting about Milchick.  He DEFINITELY knows Dylan as an outtie - maybe even as a family member, but at least as a close friend (in the same way Cobel knows Mark). 

Finally, in Cobel's shrine in the same shot as the ID bracelet and tube, is that a FINGER TRAP?  We've seen Cobel playing with one before.",2,1647735593,467

The whole show is a critique on capitalism taken to the extreme and pro Marxism. The workers are starting to unite here whereas Lumon wants to the perfect corporate drone. Ultimately the workers will revolt.

Seems like this has happened before and is the source for the coup Dylan mentions except Lumon has basically spread propaganda to rewrite the history. That’s why the maze layout is more effective than locking each department in by itself. Humans are a tribal animal so if locked into a 4 person room, MDR will more quickly rise up against management as the ‘other’ because it’s the only option. But with a maze, it lets MDR think of the other departments as the ‘other’ instead.

i1ghcqo,6,I_rescue_dachshunds,"I went back and watched all of the episodes yesterday, paying careful attention to details (something I didn't do the first time around). I had a couple of thoughts that I hadn't yet seen posted, although it's possible they were. I didn't have the patience to go back and read 2238 (current count) posts.

First, the goat/jester characters appear several times throughout the series. The painting that Burt and Irving admire together in the waiting area for the sessions with Ms. Casey have both characters. So does Mrs. Selvidge's shrine. I believe they both might be in Devon's home, too, but I have to admit, that was one scene where I was distracted. Also, the bathroom that Petey wears at Mark's house (red and blue brightly striped that Mark thinks is ugly) is very reminiscent of the Jester's stripes on his headpiece.

Second, the Senator's wife reminds me of a Stepford Wife (if any of you remember the movie), particularly on the playground. She seems to be more engaging and more of a real person talking to Devon when they meet over coffee and labor. On the playground, she was either confused because she didn't recognize Devon or she was intimidated by her husband, or she was one half of her severed self. But she definitely didn't seem to be the same person. The premise of The Stepford Wives - that husbands would band together and have their wives turned into bland, compliant, robotic-like women - could be a reason for going public with severance. And just imagine how that might help parents deal with wayward toddlers and children. Sever the brain so that there would only be well-behaved children who never challenged their elders, toddlers that never had temper tantrums, babies who never cried. I think the baby goats (whom we already heard could make quite a ruckus when hungry) are test subjects for such an effort.

One by one, the MDR team has started to question what Lumon is doing. Helley didn't like it from the very beginning. Mark started to get curious after Petey showed up. Dylan now has a reason to be suspicious, having seen his son while he was an innie. Only Irving continues to spout Lumon crap. I would guess that over time, the attraction between Burt and Irving (almost said Ernie, LOL), is going to grow so strong that Irving will have to deviate from Lumon's handbook in order to avoid real cognitive dissonance. And once the fearsome four are in sync, I predict stuff is going to go wild. Of course, Dylan's change of heart depends on whether his Innie remembers what happened in the closet. I have a slight suspicion that the switch that turned Dylan's Innie on and off may also erase memories in which case this paragraph is null and void. 

The items that O&amp;D have been creating - a hatchet and a watering can - are both related to trees/foliage which, coincidentally, are in the room that Burt considers his secret place. One destroys (or severs) and one nurtures. I keep thinking that nothing is coincidental in any of this. Various items are shown to the severed people and their reactions are observed. The basement is nothing more than a big behavioral laboratory. The fact that Milcheck rigged the copy machine so that Irving would see the picture of the coup and Corbal referred to it by a specific code# (as in an experimental treatment) makes me think that a lot of the other items thrown at the severed peeps are also experimental treatments. Lumon just wants to see what severance does to a person, given a variety of situations. I do think that there was a coup when something triggered one group to attach the other and those people were destroyed. However, the two teams are now being set up again to see if the latest version of whatever they stick into your brain has been improved to the point where that level of conflict doesn't occur.

So many more thoughts, but not enough energy to write everything down right now. Plus, I want to see what happens next week to see if those match up with any of these observations, before I offer anymore. I do think that Lumon has plans to take severance outside of the workplace. That may be where it started but there are a lot of other potential applications of severing a brain. What's to say that they are not examining multiple applications!",9,1647814214,751

i1hppow,6,ToughAlgae6867,"I believe Dylan is a widower. There are women's shoes in the closet, mom isn't home when Milchek comes in, and sure, moms can be out with friends, grocery shopping, working, etc ...but I was widowed young with 3 kids, so I feel like I can add to the conversation. 

* I feel that Milchek would have made sure mom was there to keep the kid out of the way, if that was an option. 

*Dylan's outie would have protested having the boss knock him out with nobody to tend to his kid if Mom was just out. Single parents are often treated like children by others who wouldn't be that pushy to someone with a partner.

* Sure, there could be women's shoes in the closet for a few reasons if he's divorced (kept them in secret because he isn't over her, he's into drag, etc) but it's more likely that he kept some of her stuff to remember her by. 

* No woman I've ever known, including myself, would just fail to notice if an ex kept or took her shoes when they split. 

* I think Dylan is struggling financially.  If he was still with his kid's mom, either they'd have 2 incomes, or she would stay with the kid while Dylan worked. Daycare as a solo parent is extremely expensive (it's expensive doe everyone, but even harder to handle alone.) 
Why is he struggling financially? Did you see their TV?  It was an old cube, (or a fastback, as my kids say.) Even I can afford a regular, modern TV. Goodwill has them (and no cubes anymore.) Also, I've had kids' streaming and cable, so I know old cartoons like Felix the Cat are never on, and I've never seen them available on streaming services. It's likely a DVD or even a  vhs tape.

I know these things sound like I could be reaching, but these types of shows are very deliberate.  Nothing is there for no reason. I could see Lumon as a very evil company, capable of murder when is benefits them. Either that, or they only like to work with people who have few friends or family members.

Lumon, rather than lose one of their assets or outright murder an employee, might have seen the value in a compromise - allow the innie to take over, giving her access to the outside world and power over other innies. Her shrine could be to her outie - the part of her that no longer exists so long as she doesn’t let it. It would also explain her fervor for Kier - many innies have an almost religious reverence for Kier, as the only “culture” they had on the severance floor. Maybe she wants to reintegrate herself, or simply stop Reghadi (someone who truly rebelled and wants to reintegrate) from making it possible due to the fact she’s shut her outie away for so long.

GoT’s last season absolutely was the fault of the showrunners.

They also didn’t have much respect for the source material, George RR Martin, or the fans. HBO would have given them all the money they needed to finish the show properly, but they had gotten bored with it and wanted to move onto other projects.

\- finally the gemma/ms casey reveal thank god!!!!! does she *know* as ms casey? there were some moments where she really lingered on mark, so i think she might know, the way she looks at him. but it might be feelings poking through.

\- i think next episode will have the innie waking up on the outside. i wonder who—probably mark, maybe helly.

\- ""i hate that term innie. so infantilizing."" more baby stuff

\- not cobel asking if mark thinks he sees his wife everywhere AND her dodging the question about the pregnant woman

i20hxhp,7,ClarissaLichtblau,"I’m going to give myself a small pat on the back and say that what I wrote in the episode 7 predictions thread yesterday wasn’t too far off:

*Now that Dylan knows he has a son, I think it will give him a motivation to join the others on the mission to figure the place out. I’m excited to see how this changes his innie and how it will add to the team dynamic.*

*Innie Mark’s purpose gets stronger for every episode. The new doors is going to boost this further. He’s going to finally become the leader of MDR. He’s not having it.*

*Irving, despite being hesitant about his relationship with Burt, sees his faith in the infallibility of the Kier doctrine chip away when he is denied seeing Burt at all.*

I also had a very distinct feeling that Alexa wasn’t going to put up with Mark’s behavior. Which she didn’t. Which any person of sound mind and with healthy boundaries wouldn’t. 

Too bad we didn’t get to see more of Helly in this episode, but I have a feeling that episode 8 will be heavy on the Helly content. 

Mrs. Selvig is now officially the creepiest person on this show. I feel very uneasy whenever she’s on the screen. Fantastic acting on the part of Patricia Arquette. And Adam Scott - playing a believable drunk is HARD, but I though he pulled it off beautifully.",75,1648173898,238

i20i2rv,7,TheTrotters,"Since the security department is bullshit it should makes us believe even stronger that the code detectors are real: if no one is surveilling them all the time to manually turn on alarm every time they leave with some note or code then they would, sooner or later, find out about it. A random post-it note in a pocket etc.

My best guess is that those cards were meant to be taken outside of the severed floor for whatever purpose and therefore something in them disabled the alarm.

Edit: my second-best guess is that Lumon people know from experience that there's a possibility of initial rebellion (see Helly's behavior at the beginning) but then the innies turn docile and do not test the boundaries. In that case close monitoring at the beginning would be enough. But I don't think that scenario is very likely. Lumon can't monitor the outies and the chance that they'll bring some information to their innies from home is way, way, way too big. It wouldn't have to be subversive or malicious: just a photo of a child or a spouse they forgot to remove from the back pocket would be enough to completely disrupt innies' reality.",73,1648173965,201

Milchick is an amazing character, he has perfected kind eyes. He’s an infectious dancer and also terrifying. How could he not sympathize with these people? He’s either brainwashed like Cobel or maybe they have some leverage over him that keeps him compliant. 

The Helly is on the board/Helly is an Eagan theories are interesting, and I agree would be a supreme twist, but I just don’t see why she would go into MDR and crunch numbers all day",41,1648174033,125

&gt; “Maybe he loves it, you’re right. Or maybe he doesn’t. Maybe he dreams every day of clawing his way to the surface. But you wouldn’t know, you’ll never know. You brought him into this world without his permission based on your own desire for emotional convenience.”

The rich are thoroughly insulated from the poor. They can go their whole day without seeing a poor person (that isn’t serving them) if they so choose. I don’t just mean the ultra-rich, either. Even middle class Westerners, even though we don’t think of ourselves as rich, never have to see the people who manufacture the abundant commodities that make our lives comfortable. We don’t even need to think about them as people. Recall Helly’s outie, “I am a person and you are not.” We Sever™ ourselves from the people whose labor makes our lives possible.

Now I'm not sure what to think, Harmony was pretty direct to The Board about what she thinks happened to Graner, which I don't think she would be if she was pro-reintegration.

I think what started the theory was that it's established in episode two that there's something special about Helly. Milchick is excited about Helly joining the team in a very specific way - calling it a ""miracle"" and stuff. Clearly, she's someone important. Then, when MDR go to that museum of Eagan, she seems to sort of connect with the Eagan statues (and, as others have noted, she does look like she could be related to them). Those things, paired with the fact she is *heavily* trying to escape and clearly won't ever be comfortable with her position, indicate she's someone who isn't used to working, and is probably used to being in a position of power (unlike the SVR'D floor where she's powerless).

It would seem that their security is bogus to a large degree because at this point, were no one to review the video feed of who used his card that day when he possibly couldn't have that would be a serious omission.

i20zqnc,7,sax-sax,"Okay hear me out: I think that each of the MDR employees represents a temper. 

Helly = Malice. I think this one is pretty obvious. She wants to see her outie suffer (hence why she tried to commit suicide). 

Mark = Woe. He is heartbroken and grieving the “loss” of his wife.

Irving = Frolic. He keeps running around over to O &amp; D to flirt and cannot keep his concentration on his work. 

Dylan = Dread. He was deeply afraid / anxious about the O &amp; D department / Burt because of the coup. 

I think this is relevant because of Keir’s taming the four tempers idea. I suspect that whatever they are doing on the computers is, in effect, taming themselves (perhaps deleting memories). When we first met Irving, he was the opposite of frolic. He was very by the book. I think he had been there for so long that the “taming” was nearly complete. However, meeting Burt changed that and he resorted back to his “frolicy” ways.

E: I like the theory, but might be a stretch, though. It requires a yet-unrevealed but entirely possible ability to ""refresh"" an innie's memory, even if just starting over from day 1 on the table. This would be a pain in the ass, because all the other innies who had contact (ie their isolated department, prior to unsanctioned fraternization) would also need to be reset lest they wonder what happened.

Helly R. was told by her outtie that she had no control over her own fate; the outtie would not let her leave. Mark has come to the conclusion that he really was Petey's good friend and Petey died trying to reintegrate. (While we know Ms. Casey is Gemma, Mark's outtie won't recognize Ms. Casey so that's not what's driving innie Mark to rebel at this point). Dylan now knows he has a son but Milchek (representing Lumon) won't tell him the kid's name. Finally, Irving has lost his love, Burt, believing that innie Burt is being murdered as punishment for having developed a relationship with Irving. They're all festering inside and are ripe to push back. My guess is that this isn't the first time the Lumon implant ""experiments' have failed. Something always gets messed up and the innies revolt. Maybe Cobel has been around for a few of these and that's why she's getting angrier and angrier from week to week because she's noticing that it's starting to happen again (hence the lockdown). Personally, I would think she would totally lose her shit if/when she realizes that Milchek has been involved with each of these screw-ups except for Mark. He was unable to get Helly R. to accept things, he was responsible for Dylan seeing his son and he wasn't able to control the Burt &amp; Irving (I still want to say Bert &amp; Ernie) relationship so chose to retire outtie Burt/murder innie Burt.

When the doc in the beginning says that Mark being an Innie for just two years basically made him a baby, suggests to me that Lumon has had this capability for a long time, long enough for an Innie to have the learned mental capacity of someone who seems (relatively) normal in the outside world.

That Music Dance Experience was hellish. It seems like the red lights really triggered Dylan's rage and caused him to attack. I knew it was a bad idea for Milchick to wake him up just to get that stupid inconsequential card he stole! Nobody could ever go back to innie life after experiencing a taste of the outside.

I felt so bad for Irving in this episode. Burt barely showed him any affection even though it is the last time they will see each other. But clearly this was the push Irving needed to finally stop taking orders from Milchick. ""You smug motherfucker."" ""Let's burn this place to the ground."" Love it!

The Mark/Ms. Casey connection really shows how nefarious Lumon is. Gemma didn't die from the accident and is instead being employed at Lumon full time as an innie who can never leave. It's no wonder she seems so robotic, she's been stuck there for the past two years. Now I feel so bad for all the times Mark and Ms. Casey had interactions in the past, with no idea of all the history they shared.

Helly is wearing YELLOW, what does it mean? Yellow is a secondary color of light you get by adding green to red.

I feel my ongoing theory of Helly not being 100% severed is picking up steam with the knowledge of who the severance surgeon is.

A human bite is one of the last injuries you'd ever want. My mother got bitten by a dude on PCP in the ER and it just festered and wouldn't heal for like a year. They threw every antibiotic they had at it.

Outtie Mark has the same coffeemaker from the office. I'm less convinced of Alexa being a Lumon operative this week, but still not entirely unconvinced. She has a habit of showing up right on time, like Milchick or Selvig.

What was going on with Natalie speaking for the board with Cobel? She looked like she was experiencing something really painful or frightening. The Eagan Family Gala is going to be a hoot.

Speaking of Cobel, how did she learn to fake being a lactation consultant so well? And why does she have the pop culture references of someone 40 years older?

Why wasn't Graner's card deactivated the moment the board found out he was dead?

Who activated Dylan last week? If two people are required to hold the switch, then they need two other than Milchick. Graner was busy playing baseball. Cobel doesn't know about it. Maybe two severed employees? That seems risky for Milchick.

That happiness is purely theoretical to his outie, whereas his innie has the privilege of actually experiencing it. His whole goodbye message was tinged with a sense of longing and irony - there was a sort of bleak comedy to the way he had to keep adding caveats to his statements since he didn't actually know what his innie was up to.

His reason for signing up for the job was to escape the reality of his wife dying. Maybe it's their way of keeping him emotionally stable enough to continue his work.

i21oet5,7,SlackerInc1,"Probably the best episode of the series thus far.

We viewers are invested in this story as an anti-Lumon narrative, so of course we are going to be inclined to think Mark should help the lady from the basement lab cover up her murder.  But realistically, from Mark's perspective, we ought to consider whether he should have immediately gone to the cops.  Setting aside what's right and wrong in the larger sense, would that have been the safest move for him?  Or was he already caught up so deep that it would just inevitably lead at some point to a ""tragic accident"" befalling him?

Seemed a little strange that Hellie was so cheerful.

""Oh yeah?  Want to go talk to her together?""  Nice.  Well played, Dylan.

This jailbreak is exciting, but it's also kind of crazy.  I guess the risk is less for the innies since they are just imprisoned there all the time anyway (although if they get fired it means they effectively die), but I just don't see how Mark thought he could bring the passcard of the recently murdered security guy into work without it being extremely risky for him.  He's lucky Harmony wasn't watching the security cameras from her office monitor.

Speaking of risky, Mark keeps making me nervous by putting stuff in his own trash bin. First the flip phone and now the clothing.  He should have burned that somewhere or at least dumped it in a random dumpster.

Love this series but there are things you have to ignore. 

Like how do they determine what the ""innies"" remember from their past? I know they try to explain but it can never really work. You remember your vocabulary well enough to have relatively complex conversations in English but not your own kid's name? Nope. That's never gonna make sense.

i22co1e,7,TeddyAlderson,"It's probably not ordered from least mentioned to most (most of these are pretty heavily mentioned I think), but here you go. My taste is clichéd, lol.

**The Double** (film) - my absolute favourite film, check out the trailer and you'll note the immediate similarities. There's *loads* of them. The Richard Ayoade one starring Jesse Eisenberg.

**The Good Place** (TV show) - Adam Scott is also in it, but that isn't actually why I'm mentioning it. I just think it's got a lot in common with Severance: lots of mysteries and questions that get slowly revealed over the course of the show, you have a central team of four thrust into an environment they're unfamiliar with as they try and overthrow the existing system, plot twists, ethical quandaries, etc (you even have a main character choosing to forget everything, much someone who is severed). Severance is a show about what hell could be, and The Good Place also offers a version of the afterlife.

**The Leftovers** (TV show) - Lost gets compared to this show a hell of a lot, but I'll be honest, I haven't actually seen it all. I have seen all of The Leftovers, however, and it is also a bit of a mystery box show with interesting ideas about what it is to be alive, also made by Damon Lindelof. There's also a lot of identity-based stuff. I think Severance will begin to tackle the idea of religion a little more head-on over time, and The Leftovers does this too. Also, Kevin seems to be ""chosen"" in a similar way to Mark - what is so special about Mark? I guess we'll find out. I think The Leftovers is a bit different though in that it doesn't really try to answer the questions it poses. I hope that Severance *will* answer the questions.

**Russian Doll** (TV show) - you have a character who is trapped, powerless, and unable to get out of their situation, much like the innies. There's an interesting mystery, too. Tonally it's very different, but I don't know, it reminds me of Severance a bit.

**Mr Robot** (TV show) - another show that was filled to the brim with interesting plot twists (some being fairly similar to what's in Severance, though I won't spoil anything). Also fairly mind-bendy.

**Maniac** (miniseries) - the retro-futurism, the mysterious scientific company, the questions of identity shown through trippy visuals... there's a lot in common with Severance. If you like one, I'd be surprised if you don't like the other.

**Ex Machina** (film) - mentioned already. Duh.

**Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind** (film) - obvious pick is obvious, but there's incredibly similar themes. The rest of Charlie Kaufman/Spike Jonze's work also bears similarity to Severance in my opinion (Being John Malkovich is probably the second most similar film of theirs), though their stuff is usually a tad more abstract. The mind-bendiness, mostly.

There's definitely other shows and films I'm completely blanking on, but these are some of the main shows and films I love that I think can be compared to Severance.

I also want to say that I personally wrote a television pilot that was about a company hiring people to do content moderation (the main character of my pilot also lost his long-term girlfriend, which was the motivator for him deciding to work at the fairly traumatic job). There was a whole conspiracy that's later revealed too - the company intentionally finds people who are grieving, preys on them, and manipulates them into working, then when they're at the job they're ground down into further submission etc. I was actually really proud of the pilot, but Severance has executed the ideas I wanted to execute *much* better than I ever could've executed them. On one hand, that's incredibly annoying and makes me feel like a bit of a failure as a writer, but on the other, it means Severance feels genuinely tailor-made for my tastes.",17,1648216407,660

i22ya2r,7,pitufo_bromista,"Given how big is the world this show wants to live and how few episodes we have plot holes are bound to happen. The issue is how dumb they could be. I have not seen a failure yet.

The issue is that if Lumon had perfect control of everything it would take years to get around said controls. So we have to assume Lumon's failures are possible. One hint was Mark saying how little effort you have to spend to control people once you figure out fear will do a lot of the job for free. So their failures are justifiable given how corporations operate, I can add a fan fiction meeting where they decide three people are enough to control the departments and how expensive is everything so minimizing employee count becomes important to the bean counters.

Given how pride plays a role in the demise of the powerful, you can imagine Lumon making stupid errors as they overestimate their power and intelligence. The sloppiness seen so far can fall under many explanations: Lumon cost cutting their employee count and counting on fear limiting the innies, Milchick and Cobel look happy from the outside but we have not seen a lot of them yet (the scarcity of episodes helps to keep things mysterious). 

Milchick panicked because of the card and tried to solve the issue behind Cobel's back. That looks correct if you assume that they don't have a close relationship and maybe even Milchick fears Cobel (Milchick may have been a visitor to the Break Room for non severed). Cobel is also distracted by her spying on Devon ops so the innies get a chance to get to the security room and they'll probably make it back to MDR. 

This is a random thought, but maybe the reason the tech in the basement is low is a way to suggest that in this world there is not a lot of automated AI stuff that Lumon could use to cut costs and when there is no one to check the monitors the innies are pretty much free roam chickens. This is also an artistic choice, but it helps to explain why Lumon is not Sauron. I love that the switches they use to turn on/off the innies are so retro BTW.",16,1648225097,382

i22ypi9,7,kirksucks,"Some notes real quick.

* Cobel says ""she wouldn't recognize Clark Gable after having a baby""  Such an odd old timey reference for a celebrity you'd not recognize.  This fits into my theory that she's an older person who's been implanted into a different, younger body.
* I'm wondering if we'll see Helly at the Eagan Family Retreat.
* When Cobel whispered about reintegration proof at first I thought she was like ""hey Natalie reintegration is possible""  but then I realized she was talking close to her earpiece microphone.. to the board.  But I wonder if this is sort of a clue that employees like Cobel, Natalie, and Graner secretly want it to be possible because they feel trapped there or something.  Like when Graner suggested they celebrate when they had proof of Petey reintegrating.   Or maybe just to prove to the high and mighty Board that they're wrong.  Maybe reintegration is part of what the cult side of Lumon perceives to be Kier's final vision or something.  And for whatever reason this goes against the corporate side of Lumon.
* During the scene where Mark picks up the ripped photo ""I'll be seeing you, in all the familiar places"" was totally a clue that we're going to probably recognize who we're gonna see in the pic.  Also Cobel asks Devon if he thinks he sees her like she saw her dead husband.
* During the ripped photo scene he's reciting things he likes about his wife exactly like it's being read to him in the Wellness Center.  Then he says he loves these things ""equally""  it's like they were getting our brains prepared for it to be Ms. Casey.
* I was waiting for the scene of Mark taping the photo to change to Dylan at Lumon after hours hitting the switch and for Mark to switch to his innie and see a photo of Ms. Casey on his table and be like What the fuckity fuck?  Then Dylan get spooked and quickly switch it off.  I guess this could still happen... not exactly but I think Mark might end up displaying a proper photo of her and when they eventually to the OTC on him he will see Ms. Casey and equally freak out. Now the question is... is Gemma still in there somewhere?

But on the other hand, if the innies escape into the outside world, what becomes of their outies?  If the innie can stay alive full-time out there, doesn't that mean that the outie ""dies""?

My theory is that eventually the severed feel the weight of their circumstances and it comes crashing down around their ears. They revolt, thus giving some credence to the painting and these whispered stories of violence. We see even the most compliant in Irv finally snap in this episode... it's like a cycle that, no matter what management does, is doomed to repeat. The severed's reality is just too hopeless, no matter what trivial gifts they receive.

Also, Milchick is really creating alot of problems for management... first the book that he left in the open, then using OTC which broke Dylan. Dance all you want in that glorious white turtleneck, the innies coming for you!",8,1648232594,147

Why so many screens and there is only the head of security to watch it. That means that the room is occasionally empty.

There is upper level technology there. I think I saw a server rack, a laptop, digital charts and reports. Will watch that scene again to check.

There are many employees but certainly a limited number of them, looking by the number of switches. However, switches seem to be reconfigurable so there could be many more combinations.

Elevators are wired. They know who is in the elevator.

There must be two persons there to follow the emergency remote wake/shutdown procedure.

The actress that plays ms casey/Gemma looks like someone who has had a shit tonne of plastic surgery to looks like various ethnicities. She could be real or not really dead or alive or a robot.

childlike and easily manipulable because they have no experience and no reference points.

i25556u,7,I_rescue_dachshunds,"I'm partially with you. But I think there is an experiment of sorts going on and the severed ones are the subjects. They are being observed to see how they cope with stress. The numbers they are choosing are entirely random; they're there to provoke the stress and Corbel and Milchick are constantly watching to see what they do. I'm speculating that the work, developing the implant has gone on for years and Lumon hasn't gotten it right, yet. The severed refiners eventually start to figure out what's going on, get worked up, and want to push back. Eventually, there's mayhem and possibly murder. So, the implant is tweaked and the cycle starts all over again but it looks as if there's going to be another fail. Eventually, Lumon hopes to get it right. But now, they've got the issue of reintegration to contend with. Until they can figure out how to keep the severed workers' focus on their work life, there's the potential that somebody's outtie may influence their innie and the rebellious feelinga will start anew. The newest theory, that some of those innies don't even have outies and live in Lumon (Gemma), would be one way to eliminate that outside influence and keep the worker bees focused on the hive. Plus, the idea that Irving might be living in a grave (dirt under his fingernails; Petey's map reference) adds credence to the idea that Lumon is experimenting on dead people and are implanting corpses).

\-First, this ep doubled down on the SERIOUS Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind vibes, just wanted to mention that though ijm sure its been said here, this is my first post in this subreddit...  


\-The final scene/reveal def made me 1000% invested in what i assume is a popular theory as far as what i tihnk the big game is for Lumon - they're gonna create an entire 'free' workforce of people who like i think Mark's wife/Gemma, have their deaths faked in the 'real world' only to become 'permanent innies' withouth anyone knowing (cant remember if he saw her body or she vanished/was destroyed etc but im sure someone will chime in :)   


\-I have a splinter theory that Mark was manipulated into working for Lumon (not just cuz they obv keep very close eyes on his outtie etc) but because they wanted to see if he would recognize his wife/Gemma over time etc (basically findin out how permanent 'severance' is)   


\-I initially thought Dylan being hyped over fingertraps/waffles was just a quirky bit of world building/character dev but now it seems obvious the intentional infantilization of the innies by Lumon is because they are emotionally newborn - so a 2year old like Dylan WOULD be motivated by childrens toys etc (and also explains why he bit Millicheck rather than punch etc, more childlike imo)  


\-Re: the baby goat/lamb thing last ep was either them doing severance experiments to animals (so seeing if they remember their mother by scent etc after severance) OR my other very long shot idea is that they want to create 'innie' personalitites that can be transplanted via a device inserted during the severance procedure and eventually so for example:  
Maybe Dylan had the implant put in during severance and as he 'learned' how to 'pick scary numbers' etc that 'instinct' he develops from scratch as a newborn innie will be datamined/recorded by the implant and after say 5, 10, 15years they figure youre good enough at it to kill off ur innie and stick the implants in literal livestock - if thats the endgame yeah its a longshot but the darkly comic/satirical look at office life would def pay off...just a shot in the dark tho...  


Last theory/idea and it ties into the last one \^ - i have three theories about why Burt suddenly 'retired'   
1. the obv option, Lumon did it to punish Irving/They were figuring out too much  
2.) Lumon WANTED them to bond only to take irving away so they can make Burt and Irving meet on the outside and see if they remember anything - basically the reverse of my theory about Mark and Gemma being married then put in Lumon/severed to see if they'd reconnect (kinda like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind)  
3.) the least likely/most interesting imo - what if they retired Burt because he just happened to have gotten to the point where his 'implant learned' how to do the job it was required for and can now be implanted into literal livestock turning 'Burt' into a Goat named Burt that can do some simple process thats now engrained in it...

i258lu1,7,fwango,"After watching this episode, I have a strong suspicion that the innies will break out and put themselves permanently in “innie” form at least for a while, potentially setting up a season 2 where *outie* Mark is the one who’s “imprisoned” / rarely exists at all.",6,1648260336,46

i25948u,7,I_rescue_dachshunds,"Let me take a stab at building/further explaining a few of your observations. 

The reason that Harmony Corbel seems so old is because she is. I think Harmony Cobel is actually Charlotte Cobel but she has an implant, possibly in a younger body. Charlotte's DOB was in the shrine in Mrs. Selvidge's house. At the time, everybody said that Harmony couldn't possibly be the same person. But I think she is. Or her implant is. I do think she's directly related to the Eagan's, either by blood or by association. She's been entrusted to manage the severed workers but she's been having problems - one coup, then a reintegration, now, the potential for a second coup. She's a very angry frustrated person at work. At home, she is more caring, worrying about Mark as she eats milk and cookies at night and spies on him. Comments have been made that the innies are more infantile. But Corbel has the opposite experience; her outtie is the more childlike one. 

Corbel was also in on the plan to implant Gemma, Mark's ""dead"" wife who may or may not be actually dead. That's why she keeps a close eye on Mark, to make sure he doesn't remember anything, but also worried because Mark seems so sad a lot of the time. It's not clear whether she has enough empathy to recognize what Petey did: ""You carry the hurt down there with you. You just don’t know what it is."" There have been a few hints in the storyline suggesting that some of the innies may have died but are being kept alive at work via the implant. But these people are innies, only; they have no outie. Gemma would be one. Irving had dirt underneath his finger nails this week. Could he have literally risen from the dead? This is also supported by Petey's map and comments he made to Mark when he stayed over at Mark's house.

I believe Helly is going to show up at the Eagan Family Gala. The subtle hints that she may be somebody special and the possible likeness to the statues of some of the Eagans make it seem like she's related to the family. 

My predictions for the rest of this season: We already know that episode 8 involves a dinner party thrown by Rickert and Devon (preview paragraph on Apple+). I think we'll get some more info on Gemma and Mark's relationship and what actually happened to Gemma. I do not believe Rickert has anything to do with the Eagans; if he does, he'd be a black sheep with his management theories. Episode 9, the final one of season 1 will be focused primarily on  the Family Gala. Something big is going to happen there. I'm betting it's the reveal that Helly is an Eagan. That will be the cliff hanger that will carry us into the next season. Somewhere between 8 and 9, we're going to get some more insight into Irving and possibly learn why he had dirt under his nails. That seems like an important detail. Mark is also going to become more curious about the reintegration process, possibly because of something he learns from Rickert, and may return to the university.",2,1648260593,540

Twice now Mark has thrown stuff in the trash that I was sure would come back to bite him just because of all the trash bin mentions and Cobel’s snooping. Petey’s phone and now the clothes. The clothes HAVE to come back and bite him. 


Marks’s outtie isn’t progressing in any direction (as compared to his innie’s growth). If anything, his outtie is worse now than at the beginning. Interesting to see the parallel that the more unhappy his innie gets, the worse off his outtie is. Don’t know exactly what to make of it. I think his outtie probably truly wants to stay severed thinking it’s for the best. Maybe he’ll betray the MDR team at the end. 


It just struck me that being severed is a terrible way to deal with trauma. You think you’ll get 8 hours of time off thinking about your pain but you don’t. You essentially create another person and all the time that YOU have as an outtie is still 100% grieving. If anything, it’s probably worse because sometimes work can offer a welcome distraction and the outtie persona isn’t getting that.

This episode opens with the first feet of central-plot progress I've felt in what feels like forever, like since Petey died, and there's so much of it. I crossed my fingers they weren't bluffing again with Graner's card. Bluffs like the map the protagonist rips up and throws away, or the cellphone he deactivates and tosses in the trash—when it's an unmotivated main character that keeps grinding on breaks to keep the plot from going places, I worry they don't have enough to say to meet their runtime. Leaving the silver haired Cobel gone rogue in a fake-moustache to nose around for filler content in her spare time. As a neighbour or a nurse.  
I fking loved how they changed the characters. Showing Dylan home with his family. Activated. Inspiring his change from the contented employee with achievement perks to a rat in a cage. The writers are mining all this gold I've been waiting for. And Irving facing Burt's departure to set him off.  
I've been feeling claustrophobic with most of the hallways stuff lately—apart from Burt romance—and frustrated that the pregnant sister's even had her own mic at all. The tiny trickle of substance in her storyline could've easily fit within the bounds of the main character's POV—give us glimpses of her when he visits. But here are hints of this paying off.  
A rich woman severed to spare herself the effort of raising children. This line totally confused me for a moment. I thought the sister's moral compass had been thrown under the bus to flatten the complexity of the severance dilemma into ""I wonder if I could sever an office personality just to make my baby for me"" (not an actual quote). Like who would have this random thought about wanting to forget giving birth or nursing etc? But of course she's talking about the rich woman forgetting her face. So there's severance for the super rich.  
All still pretty peripheral to a plot full of more compelling things to say, but as long as there's meat in an episode I don't mind.  
And finally something juicy parts with the grey lady. Getting in the secretary's face. Good stuff.  
I might be tripping balls here but the idea that the ending plot twist means his wife is the dead-half of a therapist's severed brain is battling my eyesight's problem that she looks....white? in the photo? Is that her? Am I blind? I mean it must be, for all the slow-rolling that THUMB did on the photo.

I think Harmony Cobel, Burt, and Irving are much, MUCH older than their characters appear, and I think Lumon’s big weird work and apparently infinite resources are all focused on engineering immortality. Kier “and his progeny” not his descendants. Harmony’s very old fashioned name and manner of dress. All three of them having those sort of jarring mid-Atlantic accents. “Nurse” Solveg referencing Clark Gable as a dreamboat. Her freaking candlelit shrine and obsession with lavender.
I’d argue she’s older than the men—based on the men’s clothes, I’d say they were born in the 1920s and started with Lumon during WWII—maybe they had to be closeted in their outie life and only their relatively young innies lack the social strictures against same sex love.

My theory is Gemma found out something about Lumen somehow. Something her outtie can't be running around knowing. So they arrange for her to ""die,"" and then sever her permanently, not allowing her innie to ever leave. She spends her entire life in the basement.

Mark then must have been recruited as the final piece in testing the power of severance. Take a man who was very much in love and had his wife taken away from him before her time - sever him - then put in him the basement \*with his wife\* and see if either of them every could possibly recognize each other. If they don't recognize each other that's the ultimate proof of concept for severance - the ultimate success.

The big point that Eternal Sunshine makes is that you can't erase specific memories without taking away big memories, because it's all connected.

Him knowing that she has had the procedure would explain his responses whenever someone is discussing reintegration. You can see that there is a part of him that does not want to follow the trail and expose what ever is happening in there. Maybe a part of him takes comfort in the fact that some part of him has a chance to see her.

I think it would also explain why Cobel is taking such a special interest in him. I don't think Lumon has trouble getting people into their procedure. You can sort of gauge that from the book. They especially don't need to steal a dead body or fake a death or do anything sinister like that. It seems like an unnecessary risk.

I think we are in for a showdown between Mark (inie) who wants to help the others to bring down Lumon and Mark (outie) who will want to just keep his wife alive.

Hard to tell still. They are all aware of the override switches but there's a chance their innies decided they loved the company more and don't care if they kill off their outtie just as an outtie often isn't thinking about their innie.  

I went over the control room scene slowly and picked up a few interesting things. 

1. We can get an idea of the number of departments and employees, they are all just coded in 2-3 letters. 

2. In some of the closeups, there are a few that are on the red LED. It's possible this changes based on if they are at work or not OR it has to do with the innie overriding the outtie full time. The latter seems more likely as the red is under the name BYPASS EMERGENCY while green is under BYPASS NORMAL. None in MDR were set to red. 

3. I couldn't see a close-up showing LEDs for Milchick or Cobel. But there is a Harmony S. and James M. Harmony as Mark's next door neighbor is referred to as Mrs. Selvig, so decent chance they're the same. 

4. On the elevator screen, the elevator is divided into 2 sections, NON-SEVERED (left) and SEVERED (right). Harmony Cobel was on the NON-SEVERED side when she was shown descending. If this division has to do with who is severed or not, this either shows she is a permanent outtie and never severed, she was severed but only uses it for some unique situations like the woman who uses it for child birth but otherwise is the same person both as the neighbor / nurse outside and Cobel inside Lumon, or she was severed but the innie overrode the outtie (so technically not split between the 2 anymore and wouldn't show up that way, and the BYPASS EMERGENCY/red could mean she's permanent innie). 

5. It's possible Harmony Cobel is the same person as Harmony S. on the D&amp;R portion of the portion of the scene I mentioned in #2 above, where the LED is red. D&amp;R likely stands for Disposal and Reclamation, which was shown on a wall label in a scene in a previous episode. 

6. The floors are marked as followers (top to bottom): 12 MACHINE, 11 EXEC. STE, 10 SR. STE, 9 CONF. ROOM, 8 CONF. ROOM, 7 IT, 6 ACO., 5 DATA P., 4 NET.SYS. Although not visible on the screen, it appears the 3 non-visible floors below the 4th (possibly more if there are also basement floors) are SEVERED, MEZZ, and ENTRANCE based on the departing and destination floors 3 of the elevators show. 

7. 13 is unmarked. 

8. On the SEVERED side, floors 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 have a mysterious icon in the top right corner of the floor name box. My hunch is indicates the floors that SEVERED have access to. These icons are not present at all on the NON-SEVERED side (assuming they have access to all floors). 

9. In the protocol book Helly grabs, the page titles shown in order are: CLEAN SLATE CYCLE, ELEPHANT ACCESS CIRCUIT, BRANCH TRANSFER SYSTEM, OVERTIME CONTINGENCY PROTOCOL (one she rips out).",6,1648312489,548

Personal theory- they are downloading people's consciousness into babies / experimenting with babies.  

I also think they can sever people in the real world.  Why can't the inner life be the real life?  Wouldn't that be a better selling point?  Telling people your life sucks but if you get this severance procedure for eight hours a day you will get your dream life.  Then they just sit people in a chair for 8 hours a day.  

Final thought- Severance=Heroin

Why is Severance such a big deal for the outie?  If they don't want to be severed then just don't show up to work / don't go down the elevator.  How is this permanent?  

Well this is the same thing people tell drug addicts,  just don't do it.

Some of the tasks we’ve seen (raising baby goats/ the self defense cards, O&amp;D making hatchets and water cans) seem like obvious doomsday prep activities. But the severed floor is actually a test chamber to test the indoctrination methods they use— there’s a lot of infantilization, treating the employees as children. This is because eventually they plan to raise actual children like this, so they are trying to see what the long term effects/ likelihood of rebellion are/ if they can brainwash people into doing the tasks that need to be done. Easier to do this with adults who already know how to speak and walk and do tasks, but are otherwise blank slates. And when the end times come (or Lumon kicks them off), for the current adult population, they plan to sever them in order to indoctrinate them quickly into following kier. My other side theory is that Alexa is a Lumon plant and that selvig, for some reason, really wants mark to have a kid— so she can raise it inside Lumon? I think Gemma might have fertility issues, since mark said they were trying for kids but it never worked, so selvig split them up through faking their deaths, so each thinks the other is dead and they chose to sever to deal with the grief.

We know that it takes a while to be able to ""feel"" the numbers, this could be due to the adjustment period. We know Helly was \*Pissed\* constantly when she first started and thus couldn't be emotionally controlled easily. 

In the last episode we see the security room with dials next to each person's name. This could be a control mechanism of sorts but at this point there's not enough info.

Could this mean then that Marks wife is actually dead and then the clone was released upon her death with her innies memories still intact (so they don’t ever need to hire new people) basically waiting until people die or leave, cloning their bodies and implanting the severed chip into their head for an infinite, trained workforce.

i2akr6l,7,NotYourGa1Friday,"I think Mark is a bigger Lumen player than we think.

If severance works properly Mark would have no memories of the Mental Health sessions with Dr. Cassie— however as he sits at his table mending the torn photo he lists pleasant things about Gemma and then says that he loves all things equally.

I’m not sure on any details, but I think Mark wrote some of these scripts. 

It might explain why Harmony almost apologizes to Mark for throwing something at him and pauses before shaking his hand.

Also, when meeting with Petey’s contact they met at Mark’s old place of employment, she didn’t bring him there for his benefit though. We know she was already stationed at Ganz University-implying there was a pre-existing outie-connection between Mark and some of the big wigs at Lumen. (Such as the scientist that implants the chips)

I think Mark may have a few levels of severance. We have seen ground level and we have seen the basement…what happens to Mark if he goes up a floor or two at the Lumen building?

What do y’all think? Possible or totally off?",4,1648371000,188

i2anrx1,7,LangHai,"Lumon is a pharmaceutical company and controls everything they consume at work, probably because they're drugging them. So why wouldn't Lumon do it outside of work? 

They do close-ups of the alcohol whenever he drinks, they make a point of showing Cobel inspecting Mark's kitchen/fridge when she goes over, they show that Lumon offered scholarships for those studying pharmaseuticals and psychology at the college Mark meets Mugabi at. I think they're drugging his food and alcohol at home.",1,1648373629,78

I've a bad feeling about this). Walken is a master ofc but the pain on John Turturro's face throughout, the handshake, and when he straight out said to burn the place down... fuck.

i2awb5c,7,Nemaeus,"I watched the episode last night.

I had this feeling that perhaps Mark’s wife wasn’t actually dead. The only way that could happen is through the mystery that this show has built up. When they revealed who she was I leapt from the couch and threw my hands in the air. I haven’t done that since Game of Thrones…and when Milchick woke up Dylan at home last week. I was literally so hype from that that I *forgot to finish the episode* from last week.

This week’s episode I noticed when Mark bent down to pick up the pieces of the photograph he ripped up that the fish in the fish tank swam to the edge of the screen and back, seemingly not all the way to the other side of the tank. The shot is framed so that it appears to be the edge of the tank but who knows? Similar to the fish, Severed individuals seemingly don’t have access to the other half of their lives. It was too prominent in the shot, too empty aside from the fish, to be coincidence. This show is insane in a ridiculously good way.",6,1648380655,193
i2awn3m,7,Nemaeus,"There’s too much there to simply dismiss it offhand, imo. Who *IS* this guy that she is married to? Mark does not think highly of him, understandably so, the guy is eclectic. However, Mark’s innie reads his words in wonder. His sister has discovered mysteries of her own and the fact that Harmony is now there helping with her baby and asking questions is *spicy*.",4,1648380907,65
i2b1365,7,auscultate,"i just... i just don't want this to be the 'bury your gays' trope - the showrunners are too smart for that.

i2b7pzu,7,Nemaeus,"I kept thinking this is really bad when he woke him up. The line between work and home was broken. Once Dylan met his son there was no turning back.

That means what Dylan took was extremely important and serious and Milchick was desperate over it.",3,1648387862,46
i2b7ube,7,saddgirlsummer,"I might have to go back and do a close rewatch of earlier episodes, but do we know how the Macrodata Refinement team all came to work at Lumon?

Of course I loved him in Parks and Rec and Party Down, but as a serious actor he is absolutely crushing it. The drunk acting scene as others have said here is frighteningly spot on, just one of many scenes that had me on the edge of my seat. I feel like he’s been kinda typecast as that Michel Bluth-esque “serious but sarcastic” type so it’s really dope to see him do well in a different genre of tv. I hope he does more thriller/serious work!",19,1648389202,97

i2be92p,7,UnlikelyDecision9820,The point I’m trying to make is that there’s an event like a switch that turns the innies off of Lumon and severed work. There is no such event for Helly; she has been against it since she woke up and it only intensifies,1,1648391064,44
i2bfu4p,7,motleyai,"In the scene where mark is drinking he’s reading about his college receiving large pharmaceutical and medical grants.  I’m guessing Lumon funded some research.

Did they say what Gemma teached?",13,1648391804,30
i2bgyzu,7,mgscheue,"The latter, I think. The outie doesn’t go to work any more and so the innie is, presumably, never activated again.",2,1648392329,21

i2bhysv,7,motleyai,"Its weird that the contingency plan requires 2 people though - I was under the impression that Ms Cobel didn’t know about overtime.  That aside, anyone notice the room seems to have a roster of who is active or not.  Looks like there is a “CL” department with a lot of employees.",1,1648392772,52
i2biroz,7,mgscheue,"I’ve wondered exactly what they can still remember as innies. When Ghana was mentioned, my first thought was “do they know what that is?” Did Helly know what jazz is, having, presumably, never heard it before? Burt’s work seems pretty specialized. Is his outie an artist and his innie has retained some of that? 
I do realize such things are bound to be pretty loosely established for the purposes of the show.",1,1648393131,72
i2bn5c8,7,[deleted],Good point! I wonder if Lumon also somehow has access to memories. Maybe the severance procedure doesn’t only separate the work and home memories but also gives Lumon some control over them.,4,1648395051,32
i2bnig4,7,[deleted],I was kinda bummed Reddit spoiled it for me (granted the post I saw WAS marked as a spoiler and I viewed it anyway) but it was still done so incredibly well within the episode.,2,1648395207,35
i2bozy8,7,purelander108,"What do ya think happens to Burt? 

And do you think Mark's wife is actually dead?",1,1648395850,16
i2bq0fo,7,SAY_HEY_TO_THE_NSA,"good observation about the license plate, but the lack of make/model in the car might be due to intellectual property/ copyright issues. 

license plate tho…",3,1648396284,25
i2brzia,7,goldenmagnolia_0820,"I like this idea. The more complex and “adult” the emotions, the harder it is to keep them compliant. They infantilize innies both on purpose (to keep them docile) and out of a feeling of superiority (believing because they know more than an innie they are smarter). Both mirror the experience of having a manager who treats an employee like a child simply because they’re lower in the ranks. In an office setting sometimes corporations forget (or wish we would forget) our complex adult worlds that “compete” for our attention. 

Also I think Gemma’s DNA was taken when she died and they cloned her for the purpose of experimenting on Mark. Ms Casey/Gemma lives in that weird facility because those are the clones of real people used to test innies like Mark. Just a theory. (:",2,1648397120,136
i2bs3m2,7,pawolf98,"Gemma supposedly died and yet is walking around.

Are we sure that Helly actually lived from her suicide attempt? Maybe she also was resurrected.

i2bskfe,7,Ragnarotico,Was I the only one expecting for that twist/reveal to be Helly instead? Threw me for a huge surprise when it was Gemma.,2,1648397366,23
i2bsznd,7,Ragnarotico,Yea pretty much. In previous episodes there's a speaker they use to allow Cobel to communicate and I swear you can hear faint heavy breathing from the speaker. Almost like whoever is on the other end is on some kind of respirator or medical machine that is just barely keeping them alive.,1,1648397545,52
i2bukru,7,Realsan,"There was some small evidence it was Ms. Casey.

During Mark's wellness session with her, Cobel gave Ms. Casey Gemma's candle to burn during the session. The candle was red on green. Ms. Casey was wearing a red dress on a green chair and they were the exact same shades.

Then there was episode 6 when Mark finds out from Cobel that Ms. Casey was in the break room. The camera zooms in on Cobel's face and she says ""She's *just* a wellness counsellor, Mark."" That was the give away for me that she was important.

And finally, Cobel asking Devon ""Does Mark ever thinks he sees her?""",9,1648398217,108
i2bv1nk,7,goldenmagnolia_0820,"Maybe Alexa is part of the team to try and bring people to reintegration. She counters a lot of Lumon stuff with Mark, saying you need to feel your emotions, telling him to process Gemma’s death, etc. she seems alarmed at how angry he gets with protestors about severance. Maybe someone on the other side trying to help him",2,1648398420,59
i2bvzmt,7,Ragnarotico,Good call outs! I definitely didn't notice/pay that much attention to these details. I guess this is one of those deep shows with lots of easter eggs and not generally the variety I spend a lot of time with.,3,1648398818,39

i2byhws,7,Asleep_Improvement80,"we know that some parts of real life come into work with the innies. they’ve referenced movies and used slang. they just can’t access personal memories. so, since we know now that mark and ms. casey were married, it’s probably likely one or both of them used to talk about loving things equally. in that sense, both of them would use that type of language regardless of being an innie or an outie. 

if mark were more important, cobel wouldn’t need to constantly be checking on him or testing his sister about whether or not he reintegrated or knows ms. casey is gemma. 

so more likely than not, it’s just a way those two characters talk about love",3,1648399877,118

1. Helly asks if they are grown for food on day 1. They aren’t but lumon is. 

2. It helps explain why kier and MDR is focused on emotions and emotional intelligence. 

3. There is a lot of focus on children and growing up: the pregnancy storylines, the childlike treatment by Milichek, and the general philosophical question of who we are and how we got there.

i2cqnme,7,Angry_Redditor_,"So Ma Casey is Marks wife.    I think they have his wife severed full time.   Kind of like how that other lady is servered because her severed self wanted kids but her real self didn't.   Maybe Marks wifes normal self found something out so they flipped her switch on.

The only thing about this is wouldn't they have seen marks wifes name in the security room switch lists?   I kinda wanna go back and see if we can find his wife's name.   Do we even know his wife's name?",1,1648411722,89

Forsén has asked for the image to be retired, and its use is discouraged by some academics and scholarly organisations. The spelling ""Lenna"" came from the model's desire to encourage the proper pronunciation of her name.

Milchick and Cobel, like Ms. Casey/Gemma, are living permanently severed lives. Years (or decades) ago they were  severed and their outies/original selves haven't seen the light of day since. Throughout  this time Lumon has indoctrinated these versions of them into  model employees that buy 100% into the Kier cult of personality, which would explain why they appear to not be severed, as Irving accuses. In reality they are severed, and the innie versions of themselves are activated perpetually. This would also explain why they're such weirdos.

Irv, being the oldest refiner, has been liquidated multiple times and still has some vestigial memory of the circumstances of his birth.

mark eats a cookie from mrs selvig, but does she ever eat? 

does milchick ever eat from the melon bar? 

a major piece of the story is that the baby wont nurse/eat

then the grand prize is a waffle party, i am assuming that means they eat waffles, but how funny would it be if they used the literal definition of the word waffle, which is either to not be able to make up ones mind or to speak or write, especially at great length, without saying anything important or useful.

i4n2w85,7,ArchAndy,"&gt;they would know that a brain dead person wouldn't regain functionality by switching over to the innie.

We don't know how the chip works and the degree of ""science fiction"" involved in the whole concept. It has to somehow keep two separate memory states (innie and outie) on a single brain. We don't know if it ""forces"" the brain neuronal pathways to re-wire by sending certain electric impulses or if the ""innie"" memory is stored somehow directly on the chip, as some sort of USB drive. 

If it's the former and not the later, I could see how the chip could help someone who suffers from a damaged hemisphere/part of a brain regain lost abilities. It would ""assign"" tasks from a damaged part of the brain to another part of it. But then again, is this how the brain REALLY works? 

Modern medicine still does not know a lot about the human brain. When they severed Helly in the first episode, she knew the USA states. The way human brain works makes it that everything you know or learn is connected to something else ""a smell, a memory, a certain image"". So yeah, it's pretty inconsistent that her innie knows about USA states (which she probably learned by looking on the map in school, or heard their names from her parents when she was a kid etc) but does not know any other things about the world outside work.

First off - the MDE.  Probably one of the best TV scenes I've ever seen.  Everything about it was perfect.  I loved the little touches, like the way Helly softly says ""okay!"" when Milchick starts dancing towards her.  Also loved that they all looked happy (well except for Dylan of course)... it reinforced how childlike the innies are. 

Secondly - Burt's retirement.  What an emotional gut-punch.  It made me realize that in real life, a person retiring from our workplace is sort of like a death in a way.  We see a person every day, they become familiar and comforting parts of our daily routine... and then they're gone.  Often a person retires and we never see them again.  Then one day we hear news that they died.  It's quite sad actually.

i2xjkh8,8,ratatouillethot,"MY THOUGHTS/ANALYSIS

* Outie Irving is painting the hallway to the testing floor??? How has he seen that 🤨
* Completely cried at the Mark/Gemma scene. Also Cobel was disappointed when it didn't work, in my opinion. If only Gemma's innie persona is awake, maybe Cobel is trying to see if someone who only has an innie persona left (Charlotte) can remember her/someone
* Okay, so I'm not convinced that Gemma/Ms. Casey is a robot; I think she just acts so robotically because she has only existed for four whole days and that's how they told her she was supposed to be. If she's only awake in half hour bursts, that's not much time to build a sense of self and self expression. We can see her real emotions developing when she confesses to Mark that she enjoyed their day.
* Since Ms. Casey lives on the ""Testing Floor"", we can assume that the ""car accident"" victims are taken by Lumon to be lab rats—the only way they can kidnap people to be experimented on without a scandal is if those people are dead.
* The Waffle Party??? Lumon-ordained lap dance...was he supposed to be Kier in the painting and whip the dancers? Also, where do they get the dancers and what do they think they're doing?
* Our brief flash of outie Helly was 100% her at the Lumon gala. I am so so certain in my Helly is an Eagan [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/tiwr6e/my_comprehensive_powerpoint_on_why_helly_is_an/), deniers try and fight me now!!!

What we saw on episode 8 was the following:  
&gt;!MDR finally finishes their quarterly quota!&lt;  
&gt;!Ms Casey gets notice she got fired a second ago after they finish the last file!&lt;  
So then my brain starts turning thinking how this could be related and other stuff goes into the sauce:  
\- The numbers they see make them ""feel"" stuff, they are related to feelings, and they seem to be purging some of this numbers  
\- The theory that Ms Casey could have been brain damaged on the accident and then Lumen got her body and somehow severed it from the braindead ""outie"" and created a functioning ""innie""

  
Now what I concocted with all this information + theory is that the files could be the corrupted memories of people Lumen got &gt;!in the bottom floor!&lt; and MDR's job is to defrag/fix/correct those memories so they can either fix the braindead half or they can somehow remove some memories/emotions from other severed people",7,1648779713,180

- When they 'recruited' Gemma to the program, Harmony had a vested interest as she's hoping Gemma and Mark would recognize each other even when severed. Also why she moved next to him to closely monitor him and why she kept arranging for them to meet.

I like that we get somewhat of an explanation for the black goo Irving's innie has been hallucinating. And it's incredibly sad that Ms. Casey is only activated for those brief therapy sessions. Does that mean Gemma is in a coma, or perhaps her outie has amnesia? And what does that mean for her ""retirement"" -- are they going to take her off life support or something?

I had to laugh that the waffle party literally involved eating a single waffle, alone. The term ""waffle party"" always sounded vaguely sexual to me (kind of like blue waffle, maybe?), so I wasn't surprised there was some weird cult ritual attached to it. Same with ""innies"" and ""outies."" My mind always goes there first.

I don't really understand what was in that box that Milchick gifts Dylan (the hologram thingie?). What is the significance of that? And why was everyone so proud to see that '90s-era computer game completion screen when Helly reached 100%? Also, now that Ms. Casey and Cobel have been fired, and Graner was brutally murdered, does that mean there's only Milchick and Natalie working at the department now? Seems like they are severely understaffed there for such a huge project.

So next week will be the reveal of all the outies. As Irving puts it: ""Okay kids, let's find out what's for dinner.""

- The innies that work in every department are real people who are training a system to map the human brain into a digital one. 

- The people who live below, (down the elevator) are dead people whose brains have been preserved. Their bodies are robots. 

- The reason they need severance for those with outties is to work with brains that have zero context so the system they are training through macro data refinement and O and D and all the departments can get good enough at helping digital brains live on. 

- This is all done to try and keep the Eagan’s alive digitally.

- The Board is dead

i2ybdg9,8,h_trismegistus,"As someone who studies geology, I would say all rocks are interesting in their own way and each has a story to tell.  In terms of geology, there is no importance given to how “plain” a rock looks.  Some of the ugliest rocks can be very interesting and or valuable.  For example, to an untrained eye, a kimberlite rock may look like a dull, dirty, ugly, worthless rock, yet it may contain diamonds.  And at the superficial level, any person with eyes can distinguish between a rock that looks plain and one that doesn’t—this is not in itself, taken literally, a superlative ability for a person to have.

So I suspect that there is something else to this “fact” about Mark S., since from the point of view of actual expertise about rocks, there is no actual meaning to the word “plain” as a descriptor, and I also don’t think it should be taken at face value/superficial appearance (i.e. there is no importance to Mark S.

i2yc2pa,8,WikiSummarizerBot,"**[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog)** 
 
 &gt;Wanderer above the Sea of Fog is a painting by German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich made in 1818. It depicts a man standing upon a rocky precipice with his back to the viewer; he is gazing out on a landscape covered in a thick sea of fog through which other ridges, trees, and mountains pierce, which stretches out into the distance indefinitely. It has been considered one of the masterpieces of the Romanticism movement and one of its most representative works. The painting has been widely interpreted as an emblem of self-reflection or contemplation of life's path, and the landscape is widely considered to evoke the sublime.

This is probably why she was so interested in Mark S and Mrs. Casey's interactions, because Mrs. Casey's innie is presumed dead but probably in a coma. I think it had something to do with proving something to her and the board about her mother, which might give her cause to be able to have her brought back or re-integrated or something.

Pete's chip proves that people can be re-integrated but also when talking about Pete's chip Cobel I think said, ""He's in there."" or ""That's him."" which almost sounds like the chip doesn't just belong to Pete but may actually somehow contain both Pete's innie and outtie, which made me wonder if you could put them into someone else, and not only would you have successfully transplanted a consciousness into a new body but you could integrate people or re-integrate them in someone else.",3,1648807192,176

i2ytmp0,8,Halloran_da_GOAT,"It’s think it’s because he paints with emotion. Recall that mark sculpted the tree (that his wife crashed into) in his one wellness session.


Emotions can “cross the barrier” between innie and outie—we’ve been explicitly told as much—so when Irving paints based on feeling, the end result winds up being something like that. I don’t think his outie actually knows what it is that he keeps painting.



I think the fact that he puts on music and the fact that they film him painting in the way they do is meant to tell us that he’s painting based on emotion. We see him allowing himself to get swept up in his feelings while he’s painting. That’s why he’s able to replicate an image that he shouldn’t really know about.


(Note that my assumption as to the specifics of why he’s painting that imagine in particular is that Burt was recently retired (remember Irving saying “you’re just going to let them kill you?!”). My assumption is that the innies have some type of knowledge of the “retirement place”. Thus, Irving paints his feelings and his subconscious mind goes to Burt’s retirement in the same way that mark’s mind goes to the tree)



EDIT: Ummm… just had another thought: Smell is tied strongly to both emotion and memory (see, eg, cobel “testing” mark with his wife’s candle and that leading mark to sculpt the tree)—it would make a LOT OF SENSE for the SMELL OF PAINT to remind Irving of Burt.",11,1648809678,249

i2yy0xd,8,Sunshine-brew,"Apologies as I'm new here but I wanted to summarise a perspective on the whole Kier worship, board, purpose of the MDR work and Harmony. That's probably too much in one go, but hey count it as a newbie splurge!

**Harmony/Ms Selvig** has been working her way to get access to the board for years for her own personal reasons. The shrine is private, personal and not known to the Lumon board, reflects a long term obsessive family connection that represents loss and hope. Prayer and worship represents longing for something that cannot be achieved through your own or other known actions, with a belief that a higher power can grant that longing. Whether this be a child or mother, the clues in the shrine suggest loss of a loved person that they believe could be restored.

She has actively sought to demonstrate reintegration or the failures of severance as a way of accessing the board and being able to speak directly to the higher power. That is why she has tried to demonstrate some connection between Ms Casey and iMark, and was so desperate to retrieve Petey's chip since that gave her access to the board. &gt;!It also explains the extreme immediate reaction to being fired and the destruction of the shrine since being fired means a loss of years of work towards being with the board and presenting the case for recovering the person she loved and lost.!&lt;

**Purpose of severance and MDR:** Lumon expends huge resources on a very small number of people and the facilities to maintain the illusion of the innie world. This requires the work itself to realise a high value in itself, it's not enough to be research as research would require iterative change, not a repetitive task. Such high and sustained value for a service rather than manufactured goods would come through maintaining power over people, extending life/cognition, or financial gain. Financial gain is too boring for the show and difficult to sustain long term. The Senators wife being severed suggests use of severance as a means of control, whereas there are multiple references to extended life or consciousness such as the perpetuity wing.

My personal theory is that MDR is a way of encoding a consciousness which can then be transferred in some other form, while this could be an AI, that would require a level of technology not consistent with what we have seen elsewhere and hasn't been foreshadowed in anyway. More likely the encoding provides the transfer to another person, with MDR either removing /&gt;!culling!&lt; the previous individual's thoughts to be replace, or encoding a known/Kier family consciousness for transfer to another.

There's definitely no robots or clones, nothing seen so far suggests any of this type of technology or even close exists in the outie world.

**Sleep and the concept of innie and outie:** How can you have two different individuals in the same mind coexist? We already do in the sleep state, which rarely cross over with dreams being remembered. The severance chips create a waking dream state while retaining access to senses and motor function. &gt;!Irving is the only person we have seen close to sleep in innie mode when there is a tiny bit of cross over to his outside experience. The door he paints in the real world would then be something he sees in a regular dream. !&lt;The question is then are those that are severed able to dream at all?

Cobel lost someone to their medical tubing, and she worships Kier himself, not Jame or other Eagans. The dolls on her bed look like Kier and Imogen (red hair, a la Helly/Helena/(Eleanor)). I think Ambrose succeeded Kier, then did something to get “banned.” Then Myrtle, who was hellbent on becoming the first woman CEO, had a short run and died the same year as her “retirement” from CEO. Some shit went down, clearly. The OG handbook isn’t the same theme as the newer ones, Dylan is “respectful as fuck” for all the other Eagans, drops the act at Kiers house. The theme is there if you look for it.  

So I say Cobel is Myrtles granddaughter, or she just got indoctrinated by going to the school founded by Myrtle during her time as CEO based on the year.

My guess is that the meaning of reintegration is ""rendering the chip inoperable"", meaning that Lumon cannot access the chip or activate any of the protocols above\*.

I think this is why Petey insisted on the term ""reintegrate"" vs. ""unsever"", because Lumon **can** actually ""unsever"" someone by way of one of the modes above, but the thing is ... the chip is still in your head ... lying dormant ...  awaiting reactivation at any point.  This rather unsettling possibility was laid bare in the episode with Dylan's ""overtime contingency"" in the closet.

Basically, the protocols are software, the chip is hardware.  My thinking is that reintegration means disabling the hardware.

i3031fd,8,Deferential_dreams,"I think you have it backwards. If they were testing whether the Innies remember, then they would want to encourage the Outie to react differently to different Outie traits. They certainly wouldn’t tell them to not react.

However, I think Lumon understands that emotions can carry between the two identities; Petey confirms this when he said he could see Outie Mark’s pain in Inner Mark. And even beyond that, if we consider nature vs. nurture, it’s not too surprising if an Innie is drawn to similar things as their Outie.

We still don’t really understand the purpose of the Wellness meetings. They may be diagnostic, especially with Ms. Cobel placing the candle, watching with baited breath that Mark remembers during his last session, etc., but my impression is that that is only Cobel’s interest and not Lumon’s. That also explains why Milchick questioned her order.

My guess is that the Wellness checks are actually meant to strengthen the Severance by anchoring the Innie consciousness. That’s why Irving needed one after he started seeing the black goo drip down the walls (which we now know is paint). Of course, this also implies that Lumon really knows how fragile the Severance process really is, which would also partly explain why they fired Cobel.",18,1648831030,211

&amp;#x200B;

1) oIrv dresses in black, paints a bunch of black paintings, and, of course, takes his coffee... black.

2) I cried when Dylan showed his prize to the other team members, knowing what the prize was the second time around.

3) Cobel's line ""I could just *leave* if I'm uncomfortable or afraid."" This line doesn't sound weird to me at all now. She is in such a rage after being fired, it's the first time it's dawned on her that she suddenly has some freedom in her life away from work. She's probably had daily moments for years when she felt uncomfortable or afraid and *couldn't* leave. You see her relief later when Mark tells her ""Work is just work, right?"" She seemed to be realizing that serving Kier isn't the only thing in life. 

4) Mark says when you wake up ""find someone you think  you can trust and tell them everything."" For Mark, the only two familiar faces will be Cobel and Ricken. It's obvious who he's going to trust / gravitate towards. The others? We can only guess, but I have a feeling the senator and his family will be at the Egan Gala. If Helly is there, she will probably avoid the other Egans, and the senator's position alone could inspire trust in a naive innie.

She also seems to think she has an outie, making it less likely she knows she’s going down.

Harmony isn’t severed. That was apparent to me when she found Ricken’s book on Mark’s porch and brought it in to work and told Milchik who it belongs to and how she found it. As to why her personality is so different inside vs outside, I’m not sure. Imo, I think she believed so fully and completely in how severance was supposed to work and support Kier Egan’s cause that she is acting as though she is severed. Sort of a fake it till you make it sort of thing. 

I think deep down, she wants reintegration to be possible for some reason that we don’t yet know. Her studying Mark’s wellness sessions and becoming emotional about their interactions; her snooping around in Mark’s personal life; and Graner suggesting that Petey’s reintegration was cause for celebration; Selvig’s happily emotional response to Mark mention of quitting.

Her innie thinks she goes up because the elevator does not signal where she is going and we know Lumon lies all the time, but she is really going to the testing room or whatever.

Some shit went down with his two first born, Ambrose (who I think is Burt), and then Myrtle who had a strong mind to be CEO then died the same year her short term as CEO ended. Suspect. Most of the Eagans died the year they stepped down. 

Then Cobel worships Kier specifically, and clearly is upset about loss of a relative to their faulty tubing (or some other coma related thing, TBD). She attended a school founded by Myrtle during her reign, and has a red headed doll in the couple on her bed. Imogen, Myrtle were both red heads.  Burt refers to the older Kier ways, educated others about Ambrose.

I posted a whole theory in “ridiculous theories you didn’t post” thread about how much all of the characters names and other elements all come back to William the Conqueror.  It’s a nutty theory, but the pattern sealed itself in my mind when Devon and Rickon names their baby Eleanor. Between that being synonymous with Helena/Helly, one origin of it meaning “other Aenor” when Eleanor of Aquitaine’s mother Aenor named her.  Eleanor is also William the Conquerors mothers name. 

William the conquerors third son was named William. Same as severed preggo politician lady, had she had the naming rights. 

Even William the Conqueors first born son who he had a tumultuous relationship with and lost a battle to, was named Robert. After their father died, Roberts brothers took Normandy from him and locked him away for the rest of his life.

i31perw,8,SonOfMotherDuck,"I realize it's a stretch, but some possible connections:

 - Macrodata Refinement seems similar to what people do to create the datasets for training an AI
 - The whole cult-like behaviour around Lumon and the founder. I could see one of their goals being to resurrect him in the form of an AI.

A cult around an AI reminds me of Roko's basilisk

Some other things:

 - People have to record a sincere sounding apology in the break room. Who are they apologizing to? Maybe it's an attempt to help the future selves of the employees avoid punishment by the AI for not cooperating.
 - Milchick takes pictures of the employees all the time. I don't think The Board cares about those pictures and the outies aren't supposed to know about what happens on the inside, so why record things that nobody wants to see? Perhaps it's to document the commitment of everyone to the building of the AI. 
 - The chips in people's heads could also be used for an AI to learn from a real human brain.
 - The theme around one version of a person having to suffer due to the choices of another version of the same person. Innies suffer on the job due to outies making the choice to go to work.

When she's innie Helly we've seen her wear different colours that contrast with the Lumon office in the first few episodes which showed her bolder streak and defiance but each episode it started to become toned down.

-So they can see their whole faces through their computers the way Milchik is just watching Helly work and sees her whole face at her desk… 
-Milchiks name is Seth lol. 
-This whole thing seems so culty to me 
-Harmony was so creepy watching Mark and Ms Casey 
-The chips work bc they don’t remember each other ahh! 
-Take Ms Casey to the testing floor wtf. That hallway was so creepy that she had to walk down and Milchiks darkened face features as she walked away. So creepy 
-THE CREEPY HALLWAY MS CASEY WALKS DOWN IS THE PAINTING IRVING WAS PAINTING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE. ALL BLACK WITH A RED DOT IN THE MIDDLE 
-A man who’s mind is as sharp as his incisors that’s funny 😆 
-this trippy egg party.. The egg party is coveted as fuckkk 
-Cobel is fired and the board responded! 
-interesting how Irving was always interested in the art and it turns out he’s a painter 
-you’re easy to pretend to care about 🥺
-PAGE 197 SLAPS
-Ok kids let’s find out what’s for dinner 🥺
-Yayyy I’ve been waiting for this kiss! 
-Is the gala doing to put a huge damper on their plan bc the innnies don’t know that it’s happening and is it happening at their facility? 
-saddest and creepiest waffle party ever. Music is epic though!
-So mark is going to awaken with Selvig/Cobel there with him! 
-Dylan did it! It seems like Irving is aware of some parts going on inside. How much exactly?
-Also Helly is TOTALLY DRESSES FOR A GALA!

i334akk,8,h_trismegistus,"After reading the Macro Data Refining Manual that is included in the Lexington letter, I basically agree.  The numbers are all addressed with hexadecimal codes instead of decimal Cartesian coordinates that reminds me of memory addresses in a buffer, within computer memory.  As this represents some kind of data that they are “refining”, and the way in which they do that is to classify them in bins, and each bin contains some preset combination of the four humors, my guess is that each bin represents a particular experience stored on some Lumon chip.  What I don’t get is that the system tells the employee if they classified the numbers incorrectly.  This implies that the system already knows the correct classification, so it is unclear what the MDR employee is actually adding to the process, besides perhaps additional “intuitive” weight. But because the system knows categorically which classifications are right and wrong, I don’t see what the refining actually helps accomplish even with “intuitive weight” added.  If the system *didn’t* know what the correct bin was beforehand, I would say the process seems like the MDR employee are training an artificial intelligence/machine learning system to more accurately classify memories that are experienced through the mediation of an implanted Lumon severance chip, so that people can be surveilled from within their own memories.  Perhaps they are not training the system, but simply providing oversight or QC, clearing the data for real-world usage.  A curious thing about the “Lexington letter” is that the writer, a former MDR worker named Peggy K, connects a bombing that kills people at a certain time in the afternoon, with the 100% completion of a single file exactly two minutes before that bombing occurred.  Maybe the data isn’t for surveillance, but rather for interrogation.

 There is some indicator that a popular view is that a number of consistent elements do connect it to the 70s. That is what writers of film and television do, they connect to widely observed social tropes so the story can translate. You can spend 5 seconds having a look at what the writers might have been referencing:

'Devilled eggs have gained a bit of a bad reputation for being stuck in the '70s, but we think this retro snack is one of the best!'
https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/devilled-eggs-recipe

Devilled eggs became popular party food in the southern and midwestern states of the United States. Popular in Australia in the 1960s and '70s, these great-tasting hors d'oeuvres are making a comeback.

https://www.goodfood.com.au/recipes/jill-dupleixs-devilled-eggs-20140408-36ait

'The melon ball drink is said to have been first served at a launch party in Studio 54. Studio 54 was the place to be back in the ’70s. All the A-list celebrities went there to see and be seen.'
The Melon Ball is like a party in a glass. 


https://onthegas.org/drink/melon-ball

Waffles entered popular US consciousness around the mid 60s, so you'd maybe expect it to be a everyday household product by the 70s. The role of 🧇 🧇  is to show how infantile the innies are treated with their childish rewards in the workplace. Not sure most people want their bonuses to come in the form of a breakfast/dessert food 🤣

In the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle, waffles were among the most popular snacks, and waffle bars reported long lines. Still, they only turned into a massive craze two years later.
https://manyeats.com/history-of-waffles/

ESPECIALLY the music experience dance scenes with Milchick in a white turtleneck. The references between music, design and food do reference the 70s pretty explicitly. Plus Ben Stiller is probably around 50 somethig  years old. So he will have grown up in the 70s and hitting his 20s around the end of the decade, no doubt the writers and numerous professionals working on it will have their references in Kubrick (famouly obsessional about details) and 70s science fiction. Make of that context what you will 🙂

Not necessarily good change. Perhaps she feels Lumon has lost touch with Kier's true intentions. Perhaps it's power, perhaps it's principle, perhaps it's fanaticism. Now Mark wants to do something.

edit: Saying that though, was it Kier’s real voice in that animation? I know it’s Ben Stiller but I mean in the world of the show — because if it *is* his real voice, perhaps he actually wasn’t far back enough to not have a new host body. But if it isn’t, then he probably is.",2,1648903413,149

i358ft7,8,Antique_Pound_1052,I'm wondering if the work all the severed employees do is totally pointless in the long run.

That the real purpose isn't even to have them do work but to observe them s part of an experiment for something bigger coming. That's why the work they do in Macrodata Refinement is so bizarre and seems meaningless.

To give it weight, they try to make it analogous real memories they can’t access.  They don’t want them to think about one item more than the others so that the overall picture they create is as consistent with the external one as possible, which presumably makes it more likely that the fake autobiographical memory will stick around and help avoid more malfunctions.",11,1648931463,102

This is a theory that I've been thinking about for the last week or so. I've been trying to post this to the sub, but for some reason it's not showing up in the thread, and I really want to get others thoughts on it. After this latest episode, I really think this could be the true purpose of the severance chip.

I've been thinking about what we've seen so far on the Severed floor at Lumon, and how they could possibly connect to each other and make sense.

Why would a company be raising goats, 3D printing seemingly random objects, and have a dept picking out numbers in spreadsheets based on emotion?

&amp;gt;!Kier Eagan believed that if you could master ""the four tempers"" that you would master yourself and the world. I think that's the key here, the Lumon cult around Kier is all based on his teachings and beliefs, and  the company basically  worships him.The Severance chip is tracking and mapping these four tempers, or emotional regions, of the brain.!&amp;lt;

&amp;gt;!Each of the departments we've seen so far are doing different activities that lets the chip read the emotional response in a person's brain, and then map each region and how it reacts.The person being severed is critical to getting pure unbiased data of how the activities they are performing make them feel.!&amp;lt;

&amp;gt;!Lumon doesn't just want to control what people are allowed to remember, they want to control what people feel.!&amp;lt;

&amp;gt;!MDR is performing cerebral work that creates a feeling based on the numbers, what they're doing isn't really important, it's not the point. [[Continued...]](https://www.resavr.com/comment/severance--1x08-whats-17723223)

But my working theory is this:
Maybe we are in present day or near present day or 5-12 yrs in the future. Whichever the case, it takes place 5-12 years after a near/partial apocalypse that has to some degree depopulated the planet (probably involving famine at some point). The price of gasoline at Petey’s death scene was like $1-$2/gallon (unless they were priced in liters), and in general the atmosphere feels sparse with humanity. The busted out greenhouse in the first episode might have just been a poetic tone setter but might also have served as a clue in plain sight. The idea that a company like Lumon would start taking over all industries would also be more likely in a scenario where the world had been teetering on extinction, and they leveraged their massive scale to price out competition and sadly earned unworthy consumer brand trust from the savings. And maybe the secretive nature of the severance work is to keep hidden how they maintain(ed) their operating margins. Btw, the film version of Soylent Green was set in 2022",3,1648939648,223

i35vdr4,8,Yeahjockey,"It can't be a coincidence that there are four of them and the four humours come into play in the artwork and the waffle party scene. When Petey is gone another 4th person is introduced into their department very quickly. In my opinion the four of them kind of fit those descriptions. I could be completely reaching but...



SANGUINE/Helly - her being introduced socially influences how they're eventually inspired to try and figure out what's going on. It seemed like they'd been working well for quite a while before Petey ""left"". She initially has quite a hysterical reaction to first becoming an inniue with the suicide attempt etc.


CHOLERIC/Dylan - don't know if this one fits as well, but does like to dominate the others in that he brags about having more finger traps, winning more perks etc.


MELANCHOLIC/Mark - outie mark obviously depressed about his loss, which still shows on his innie (as petey mentioned). I think his innie also fits the other descriptors (/Avoiding/Conscientiousness/Cautious)


PHLEGMATIC/Irving - Schizoid, like when he almost falls asleep and his outies consciousness seeps in with those schizophrenic type hallucinations. Seems very supportive to the rest of them and like the steady one of the group, when it comes to doing the work.",12,1648940817,209

It sounded like Mark was the voice on the speaker of the board.

What if the Mark is a clone of the real Mark who is in charge of the company. He lives in Lumen with his wife(Ms. Casey) who only severs every so often for wellness sessions. 

Cobel was sent to keep an eye on clone-Mark to make sure he doesn’t have any sort of memory of everything. Though I think she doesn’t have the full info on everything. Mark being the “board” and not speaking would make sense because if they were keeping it from Cobel she would have recognized his voice when he spoke. Hence him only saying one word. 

Flaw in this theory is how they implanted specific memories into the clone Mark and didn’t include the fact that he is the lumen board “boss”

It's unlikely Ms Casey has an outie (otherwise why does Mark and everyone else think she's dead?). Instead, she's an attempt at resurrection of Gemma. They are trying her out by letting her interact with the severed workers a few hours at a time. 

But the procedure is either incomplete or not very successful, which is why she seems to lack some human qualities- she is affectless and unable to interact normally with other people. 

So she's 'fired' and sent back to be tested and either replaced with a new attempt, or maybe....refined? 

The other part of this is Corbel- the shrine to Kier with the breathing tube labelled Charlotte Corbel- could be that a relative (her mother?) died and then Lumon either promised to bring her back, or else successfully did so. Which would explain Harmony's religious devotion to Kier.

Perhaps the chips record data that can be used after death to recreate someone's personality. When they have Petey's chip, Corbel and Milchick talk about it as being Petey, as if the chip contained Petey's essence somehow. So maybe we'll see Petey (or some version of him) again at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

E8:  
\-Irving at park reading with dog, Radar  . Reading Marcus Aurelius - The Emperor’s Handbook. Heads home, ‘Leonara Lake’ is name of apartments or subdivision.   
\-black coffee. Impersonal kitchen.   
\-he goes to paint. Paintings all black, black goo, he is painting the elevator DOWN to where Ms. Casey went (will go?) Heavy metal plays. Ace of Spades Motörhead. Frantic painting, all black, leaving one bare wood center till he covers it up. We look out of the painting as he covers the blank  
\-our MCs all in elevator, arriving at work montage.   
\-Helly is deep in concentration trying to finish her file before the deadline. -everyone is nervous, Milchick and Cobel are watching from computer camera remotely, nervous.   
  
\-Cobel tells Milchick that she wants Mark to have an End of Quarter wellness session for Mark. Milchick is skeptical. Cobel tells him mr grande sits with keir now and they are satisfied with him. Clearly this has deep meaning for both of them  
  
\-Helly gets a cheesy ‘inspirational’ computer vid of kier as reward. Kier flies away  
\-Mark meets with Cobel for the EOQ review I guess.  Very awkward laughing Cobel and Mark. So weird.   
\-one person can stay for the waffle party. Mark chooses Dylan, it’s part of their plan for Dylan to stay behind.   
  
\-Cobel says, “I… Lumon… needed this  
  
\-Mark goes to wellness w/ms Casey. Her office is boxed up. She is retiring at the conclusion of this session.   
\-ms Casey starts giving Mark affirmations. He tries to talk to her about more personal things. She reads him affirmations about his outie.   
\-Mark offers to help her keep her job, she tells him her life has been 107 hours long. Her fave was the 8 hours she spent in their dept.   
\-Mark offers again to help, she asks why he cares. He says they are people not parts of people. Cobel is watching. She seems to approve of what he’s saying.   
\-It is revealed that Milchick is there too, watching the wellness session. He says it’s good that they don’t remember each other. Cornel with seeming suppressed rage tells Milchick to “take her back down, to the testing floor”.   
\-Milchick sends casey down long dark hallway to elevator shown in Irving’s painting  
\-Mark goes back to MDR, they briefly discuss plan, Milchick gives them a “pre-waffle-party egg bar” Dylan will get his waffle party at close of day  
\-Dylan requested something specific for his extra gift, we don’t see what it is as he opens the box. Rest of MDR looks in box and give all give him an appreciative pat or touch  
  
\-“The egg bar is coveted as fuck”- Dylan  
\-Helly offers to stay behind so Dylan can see his kid. Dylan says this is just the first step and insists he be the one to stay behind  
\-Natalie confronts Cobel about Helly trying to hang herself. They also discovered Cobel has been spending time with Mark’s sister. She is fired. Cobel shows weakness distraught. The board IS there (speaks directly to her, one word).  She wants to explain to the board at the gala that night. No-go, she has to leave.   
\-at the Egg party again, Irving selects a Lumon book from the wall alcove. Compliance. Searches for passage, summary of the passage: do all things well because you are doing them for kier. Smashes an egg in the book at this passage.  
\-Helly jokes to Mark that the goats lay the eggs. They talk about being scared of getting caught. Helly says it’ll be ok.   
\-They have a moment where they admit they care about each other   
\-Milchick ends the party because he has vague management issues to deal with. He will return to escort Dylan to waffle party   
\-Milchick escorts Cobel out. He is cold and impersonal but underneath seems affected   
\-“SVRD” threshold restricted (door sign) as Cobel is leaving.  
  
\-why does Dylan want to be the one to operate the protocol so bad? (my question)  
  
\-back in MDR, Mark reads a passage out of Ricken’s book for inspiration to carry out their plan to waken their outies).  Dylan finishes the quote proving he knew about the book as well. “Page 197 slaps!”  
\-Irving, Helly, Mark gather at elevator. Irving goes, Helly and Mark joke maybe they are spouses irl, she goes, but stops to kiss Mark ‘in case they don’t come back, or in case they do’  
\-Mark is last to go, clock at 5:04.   
\-Dylan in bathroom looking at notes. Milchick comes for him.   
\-Mark on stairs in Lumon main lobby, Workers outdoors are preparing for gala  
\-Dylan follows Milchick to perpetuity wing, with his gift in hand. Is taken to Kier’s house. Enters. Dark. Waffles on table. He sits and pours syrup. Begins to eat  
\-Cobel freaks out on her drive home. Directed at “her” (Originally thought her was Natalie, but then decided that was assuming too much. Irv refers to Lumon as “her” in E4(?)). Religion, curses, burning   
\-Dylan, note under waffles says, “GO NOW TO THE FOUNDERS BED” cause that’s not sinister AF  
\-paper mache mask of kier on bed. He takes his gift box and goes to bed. There are chains/whips (?) labeled with the 9 virtues or whatever they are called. He sits on bed with mask on, gift in lap. ID card around neck.   
\-people in masks and lingerie enter. Bride, goat (male), old person, female, joker - woman?. Suggestive dancing. (Later saw pointed out that they are the 4 humors and correspond to a hallway painting.)  
\-Cobel at home now, freaks out destroying Lumon propaganda decor/alter.  Looks like hospital bracelet and some medical tubing. Bracelet says “corbel, Charlotte. DOB: 3-17-44, 194-301-092  
\-masked dancers finish, but Dylan has left to go to control room, so we don’t know if that was the end of the Waffle Party or not.   
\-Mark ‘pops’ over to see Mrs Selvig, asks her if she wants to go with him to Ricken’s party.  She says no, but then agrees to go if she can drive her own car so she can leave if she’s awkward or uncomfortable  
\-Irving at home now. Coffee, same routine as earlier  
\-Mark arrives Devon and Ricken’s house. Ricken has silly book convo w/Mark, Devon and baby arrive to save Mark from further silly book talk  
\-Mark tells Devon he’s pondering a big life decision  
\-Dylan enters control room.  
\-Irving setting up to paint again  
\-Mark tells Selvig ‘work’s just work’. This seems to be a revelation to her.   
\-Dylan ties door. Prepares to do procedure. We finally see his gift. It’s a laser acrylic plaque of our 4 MC innies. Awww!  
\-Irving - Dylan (scenes going back and forth)  
\-Mark tells Selvig he’s thinking of quitting. Selvig is… relieved, happy, hugs “do it, get away from them”  
\-overtime procedure is imminent, Dylan trying to turn both switches. We see Irving painting, Helly dressed up AT A GALA(?), Mark and Selvig hugging…  
\-dylan flips both switches

i39mmaa,8,StoreConfident2893,"I agree with all you said about being Kier, but while I also agree it is not merely about sex, the inclusion of sexual elements is of course deliberate. There are many ways of building tension without anything erotic. 

Sexual needs are very distinct from other needs. Of course, power comes into play for many. Domination, subjugation, etc ensue. But this is then playing out power dynamics in an intentionally sexual context. 

I don’t believe sexuality is a metaphor at all. 

Rather in this case where those running an empire demand sexual acts from their staff, even if it ‘ended’ at stripping down to one’s underwear and performing some erotic dance, they simply demonstrate that they can take from their employees whatever they want. 

It’s about compliance, obedience, and giving up any and every part of yourself that the one in charge decides they want.

This is also why innie Helly was so confused when they woke her up… the last thing she remembered was hanging on the way up the elevator.

So, outie Helly knows that innie Helly hanged herself. The only other people who knew about it (as far as we know) are Cobel, Graner, Milchick, and the MDR crew.

This was last episode, but Burt's retirement party scene introduced me to one of the most beautiful songs I'd never heard before. That scene blew my mind because of how well the music matches the mood.

i3eqk5x,8,ABrandNewEpisode,I thought about this a lot!  In the scene where we see Dylan in overtime in his closet- milcheck calls someone to end it and they physically switch him back. It wasn’t like a release- ie a spring loaded thing that goes back on its own. So he shouldn’t have to hold anything to prevent the switch from going back to a detent position.,4,1649109175,64
i3evaqk,8,PhoneSteveGaveToTony,"

After rewatching this last episode, I have a couple theories going into the finale. I’ve browsed the sub, but haven’t researched these theories in depth, so I apologize if these have been mentioned a bunch already. 

First, I think Dylan *might* die in the finale. I thought his gift choice may have been something to help him hold the switches, but we see it’s their group photo. He could still end up using this in some way, but part of me thinks the explanation is more simple: they’re showing us his love for the team and his feelings about having a son so that we’re *devastated* by his death. As of now, he doesn’t have many loose story threads compared to the rest of MDR. Mark is the main character. Helly is likely who the community thinks she is. Irv obviously has knowledge of the testing floor and is starting to bleed thoughts over between his two sides. Aside from general intrigue, the only thread I can think of for Dylan is why he hears what he hears in the Break Room. That could be explained in a brief flashback as he dies, or he may very well live and have a lot of story left to tell. Something about the end of the last episode just makes me think we might be losing him soon. 

My second theory is just tinfoilhattery and likely very wrong, but I don’t think Alexa is a Lumon plant. I think she’s working specifically with Cobel to pursue reintegration. I’m not convinced they’re both working with Reghabi, but simply have a shared interest.",2,1649111126,269
i3f40rj,8,Devildogs-75,"Agree with this theory 100%! I had the same exact thought. I think we've been thrown a bunch of cleverly and well placed red herrings (that, for the most part, it appears everyone has bought into). I'm going to put together a post outlining some theories with the details and info to support them. In short, I think Helly and Mark are at the same party. I think quite possibly that Ricken and Devon's party is the 'Eagen Family Gala"". I believe Helly is someone of stature and importance, but not an Eagen, and not a board member. I feel like we are in for a huge reveal that will stand the show on its head. Mark and Devon have a few exchanges throughout the season that stand out as odd or peculiar (will detail in post to come). I think there's a chance that Devon, the one person in Mark's life who appears to offer Mark warmth, love, and consideration, is the exact opposite of what she appears to be. In fact, she may be someone of significance and importance in regards to Lumon and/or the Eagens.",2,1649114535,188
i3f741l,8,Minimum-Kangaroo6205,I don’t believe she is a board member or a part of the Eagan family as some of the theories have speculated. But she is of significance to Lumen in some way I believe.,3,1649115763,34
i3fcy52,8,Weird_Wolverine_6276,I totally agree with the Helly idea that she has a bombshell to drop because there was a quick side comment from someone during the stairwell scene that they were so happy/honored (don’t remember the direct quote) to have her a part of the team.

i3fjxm4,8,acidnbass,"I think charlotte is cobel’s mom (rather than daughter) based on the theories of the age from the name tag (1940s DOB).  But I think in the same sense you mention, the mom could have been in some tragic accident and they used severance to revive her in some capacity, but when she came to, she didn’t recognize her daughter (Cobel), and that trauma of not being recognized anymore by your mom maybe is what made Cobel obsessed about trying to trigger recognition (the Gemma’s candle in Mark’s therapy session, giving Mark one last therapy session, asking his sister if she knew if mark ever “saw” Gemma) and reintegration (proving Petey’s reintegration despite the board vehemently denying it’s possibility)",2,1649121123,119
i3fp4g3,8,binderbeats,"Irving theory:

This isn't necessarily a new theory but i wanted to add a few things. 

  
I think a branch transfer or reset was used on Irving, that would explain why he knows about the elevator down to the testing floor. He used to be milchek or graner. His full name is **Irving Bailiff**, as in the individual responsible for keeping order/watching prisoners. Lastly, his profile on the LinkedIn page says he has been working at lumon for 9 years, but we know he has only been severed for 3. He must have been the old milchek, or maybe the old graner. Milchek took ms casey down, but we don't know if that would have been graner's job had he still been around. 

He also easily could have been the one who physically painted the art pieces we see around the office, explaining his interest in them almost like he is proud of his work but doesn't know its his work. 

He could have also been the guy previously in charge of the goats, and remembers the elevator because when the goats are ""ready"" they go down to testing to do god knows what. He did show medical knowledge after the MDE that could mean he was previously involved in the testing side of things. 

There is also a popular theory (that is probably the most likely) that burt and irving worked together in O&amp;D or another department previously and were reset/branch transferred due to love beating severance but that has been mentioned multiple times so i wont go into too much detail. They wouldn't give the role of Burt G to someone like christopher walken if there wasn't more to the story.

My main theories about Mark's wife is she is either connected to Lumon and intentionally faked her own death for some reason, or Lumon told her that Mark was the one that died and figured out how to keep them from seeing each other somehow (or at least made it incredibly unlikely they would run into each other as outies) so they are both going about their outie lives thinking the other died.

I do like your idea she is a Lumon scientist, though. I hadn't considered what her role was at Lumon, but her being a scientist would explain why she was sent downwards to testing in the elevator.

She get permission from outie *and* innie Petey \[because she does believe that inniePetey is a person with rights\] to reintegrate. They agree because 1. inniePetey knows of the pregnancy and wants to see that mother and baby are alright - and not knowing Devon has a partner \[how could he know - she didn't know\] he thinks maybe they could become a family - if outieDevon keeps the child. 2. outiePetey agrees because he wamts to know why he was fired - maybe he was even told he violated policy and hearing  the rumor that an unidentified woman at Lumon became pregnant - he wonders if there's a connection.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In terms of the timeline, Mark could have started his job at Lumon and innieMark would have no idea he was working with his sister and vice versa \[although outieDevon might have know she recommended Mark join her on Lumon's payroll after grief over the loss of Ms. Casey made him unable to keep his job at the university\]. Maybe Devon was hired while they had a program/experiment to have three personalies - outieDevon, implanted memories of a fake day of work at Lumon as an unsevered employee, and - what she was actually doing all day -as - unknown to outieDevon, an innieDevon. So, she, Ricken and Mark have no idea she is a severed employee - and thus it doesn't come as a topic of conversation at one of Ricken's undinner parties.

Selvig/Coval is an imposing, mysterious boss and a cooky, widowed neighbour, both coded to be much more than 5 years older than Mark, whereas the actor playing Ms Casey is 10 years younger than Adam Scott, and the one playing Helly is 13 years younger. Not to mention that Devon being a first time mom probably isn’t older than 35, and her and Mark don’t really have the dynamic of siblings super far apart in age. Mark is probably supposed to be in his late thirties or very early fourties rather than 50, and Selvig may be older than Patricia Arquette. I recently saw another mystery show where the identity of a character was central to the plot, but it the actor playing her was 20 years younger than the character, making it impossible to figure out.

I know that they don’t take their memories onto the severed floor, but I feel that more has to be adjusted for Mark in order to make him that chipper, childlike man boy. I feel like his personality has been dialed back to a more innocent time, before he had memories of this car accident and maybe even Gemma. Helly just has to be herself but lacking any personal information. Mark needs to be himself without any personal information and without crippling depression disassociating him from his immediate environment. I know that the depression is only there because of the loss he’s experienced which is contained in his memories, but he might now have to know the details to stay sad. I think that his brain has to be altered a bit more than Helly’s is order for him to be a productive person. In order for him not to be depressed at work, shouldn’t they supplement the implant with a blast of serotonin to his innie brain so that he can function better?

it seems to me like the whole severance floor is like research aimed to test that severance chip is both 'effective' and 'permanent' - that's why the severed teams are watched so closely, like lab rats ; )
""you know it's good that he doesn't reconise her"", says milchick to cobel "" because it proves that the severance chip works properly"" (paraphrasing - something like that)
maybe the macrodata number fields are made up of numbers that are important to the outies - like birthdates, telephone numbers, home addresses, and some of them are 'scary' numbers, like ""9-11"" etc.  so it could be a kind of research to find out what kind of numbers can leak through the severed chip... 🤷‍♂️",1,1653707827,129

'open house' sounds a lot like 're-integration' which we know lumen thinks is impossible, but maybe they only think it's impossible outside of severance chip control? (we also would have thought the 'overtime' effect was impossible too, until we became aware of it ;)

A *massive* cliffhanger would have been to end half a minute earlier, leaving us not knowing if Mark saw the photo in time (or alternatively not knowing if he communicated it in time) and similarly not knowing if Helly had the opportunity to address the gala in innie mode before the overtime contingency was switched off.

I'm glad they didn't do that, though.  All in all a great episode, that advanced the plot nicely.  I didn't really expect the overtime contingency to last the whole episode - I was expecting it to only last a few minutes, and hence largely fail in their attempt, but to set up the plot for them to try again.

Unfortunately i don't think marks brother in law is going to get the message and as soon as marks outie switches on, he'll try and pretend it was nothing. Although his sister now knows so it will be interesting to see how that plays out and whether she convinces mark to quit and if i recall mark did say he was thinking about leaving. Hellys speech is probably not going to have any impact on severance and they'll sweep it under the rug and maybe just pretend it was a joke. Burts outie doesn't know irving so by the time the door opens, his outie will have switched on and won't remember why he's there but this might lead to them actually getting to know one another. I'm curious what will happen to dylan and how Lumon will look to resolve this. Perhaps using one of the other commands that can wipe memories and do other things we don't know yet. Helly being an eagan was predictable and many people said as much only a few episodes in but her segment was still really good.

As for Gemma, i don't think that's actually marks wife at Lumon, she might only be ""alive"" through severance and the real gemma maybe was braindead after the accident and this was a way to keep her alive and a permanent worker at Lumon or someone they can freely test on that isn't legally alive. So if mark wants to ""rescue"" her, she will have to be permanently severed while outside of Lumon otherwise her brain might not be functional or she may be comatose. Dylan took one for the team and sacrificed seeing his son/family so the other 3 could get a chance on the outside. I really dislike mrs selvig/cobalt, at first i thought she was going to help mark go against Lumon but she sees an opportunity to get back in by exposing them to Lumon and how convenient that marks innie switched on right as he's hugging her.

i3ulguz,9,Blitzer407,"Theory: Why did Irving become severed in the first place?

We saw Irving was a veteran, just like his father. We see Irving with a list of names, and those names mapped out at across the town of Kier. Plus more effort in trying to identify others like an investigator. But why is he doing this? Why is he severed? PTSD coping seems like an easy answer for becoming severed, but the secret list of other severed people and mapping their locations does not add up with that. We also know that Irving has been severed for a *much* longer time than the others (at least 2 years? Idk I'd have to rewatch).

We also see Helly's father remind her of the severed tech having blue and green lights, and young Helly childishly told him ""they are so pretty, everyone should have them"". Given Helly's age now, that hints that this tech has been around for a while.

But the public hasn't been all that exposed to the severance procedure for an extended period of time.

What if the severance procedure was initially developed for use in war? You have enlisted soldiers that are easily indoctrinated to do your will, and they have no recollection or PTSD after their tour is complete. Irving would have been involved with this severeance program as a soldier, and it explains why his so interested in secretly tracking down other people. I believe there was speculation last episode that you could wipe the memories of an innie due to the executable options besides the overtime procedure. Irving's wartime innie was wiped, and then a new one was made for Lumon. This general use case for combat soldiers also may explain the combat cards made in O&amp;D.",1107,1649385685,292

Marc is somehow central to the experiment because they went to the trouble to fake his wife's death to get him to join; many here said that Covel takes a special interest in him.

They all go back inside for different reasons - Marc wants to find out more about the possibility of his wife being alive, and the others will keep going too; they will be accepted back because they are somehow crucial to whatever is going on.

About what they do there - I am torn between thinking that they actually do not do anything, they are just the test subjects for the severance experiments; they are providing data for an experiment based on their different backgrounds/personalities; they decide who gets to live or die in some weird situation.

Covel will likely be reinstated. The sister/brother will help Marc. Mrs Selvig will disappear. The innies will be tortured and separated. It is a company/cult scenario.

I didn’t think there was ANY way Mark would say something about Gemma in time. 

I’m wondering where they go from here?

I mean there’s NO WAY they’d let the innies back in work near each other to discuss. No way. 

But even if you wipe the minds of the innies, there were SO many people around Helly and around Mark that they’d know something was up right? 

Unless Devon immediately pulls Mark aside when he wakes up and then the rest of the party guests are just frazzled by the baby incident. But then all eyes would be on “Selvig” like the guests would all be talking about that right? 

And The Helly portion could MAYBE be played off as a joke had she not been tackled.

Telling instead of showing  is one of the clearest distinctions between a bad writer and a good one, and they haven’t done anything in that vein the entire season

- How in the hell did Corbel know that wasn’t outie Mark?? We’re supposed to believe she put it together because his hug became tighter when they switched?? (She put it together before he said her name, stop it)

- Irv’s first reaction upon switching is to go to a dude’s house that he **knows** does not remember him at all?? No fuck that, his first instinct is to **unlock a chest in the closet**?????

- Skipping Mark’s sister’s initial reaction to finding out he’s innie Mark, i mean just come on. **Come on**. There are times where you do that because the audience can put two and two together (ironic considering what issue #1 was) and there are times where you don’t specifically for the sake of satisfying moments.

One thought I had (sorry if someone has brought this up before, this is the first time I'm checking this sub - I literally only started watching the show over the weekend):


What if...rather than ""wiping out"" innies' memories, they just sever them a second time? Like the innie is severed rather than the outtie?
What if the characters we've been seeing are innies^n? 

So there are multiple iterations of the innies (which seems to be what the opening sequence is hinting at), but we don't really know who the ""real"" person is? Maybe we've never even seen a ""real"" outtie, and the people in the town are actually all innies without realizing it?


This might explain some of the time gaps going on, since there's more than two layers of consciousness for some/all of the characters?
Also, with Irv mapping out the town...it's giving me Petey mapping out the severed floored/building vibes.


Again, not sure if these questions have been brought up before! If so, please let me know. Would love to read more thoughts about it!",2,1649387357,190

The OA (Netflix): &gt;!The characters dimension-jumped into the actors. As in, The OA becomes Brit Marling and Hap becomes Jason Isaacs. They're in the middle of shooting the tv show ""The OA"" and OA-Brit falls and hits her head. Hap-Jason tells the ambulance guy he's her husband and they go off in the ambulance. Then we see this shot of the ginger running and jumping into the ambulance and he says ""Hey, Hap"" or something to that effect, and Hap's face is like ""Oh, not you again!""!&lt;

Then it got canceled!

Vampires (French Netflix): &gt;!We've been told all season that the MC's dad is dead from a vampire feud. Then we find out he was a geneticist, and actually married her mom and had her to experiment on them in order to discover the vampire secret because it's an illness in this show. Then, in the last episode, we found out that he's been alive all this time, and the MC's half-bro has kept him prisoner. Turns out, Dad turned himself into a vampire.!&lt;

It's in limbo because of COVID, because I haven't heard of it being canceled yet.

I Am Not Okay With This (Netflix): &gt;!MC has psychic powers. Turns out they're genetic. Has a hard time at school, and figuring out if she likes her friend romantically or not. Slowly figures out powers with help of other friend. Turns out some shady shadow-creature is following her because of her dad. Cue Carrie-style Prom after being forced out of the closet, and she runs to the nearby fire-tower or whatever. Prepares to jump off said tower because of Carrie Prom, meets shadow-creature, and he wants to recruit her to a X-Men organization.!&lt;

It got canceled, supposedly because of COVID.

In the Flesh (BBC): &gt;!After the zombie apocalypse, Zombies are being cured. Kieran Walker returns home to a conservative English countryside town of Roarton. Meets fellow Cured Zombies and discovers dead boyfriend is alive. Adventures ensue, and due to boyfriend's dad's internalized zombie and homophobia, murder-suicide occurs. Cue Kieran having a second mental breakdown, but ultimately stays alive because his fam is there for him.!&lt;

&gt;!Season 2 starts, and times are a-changing. Gov't enforces indentured servitude upon the Cured (I forgot what they're actually called.) and a handsome Second Rising priest (They believe zombies are miracles and more will come soon) comes to town in search of the Chosen One. And Kieran's Cured friends are also brewing trouble. Cue quick romantic development of Kieran x priest, and a town civil war because of said trouble. Cured friend is shot by priest because she might be the Chosen One (""if CO dead, then zombies rise""), show ends.!&lt;

 &gt;A company town is a place where practically all stores and housing are owned by the one company that is also the main employer. Company towns are often planned with a suite of amenities such as stores,  houses of worship, schools, markets and recreation facilities. They are usually bigger than a model village (""model"" in the sense of an ideal to be emulated). Some company towns have had high ideals, but many have been regarded as controlling and/or exploitative.

Instead of stopping her work on the Helly story, she is going to continue to work at Lumon and make sure she is suffering inside to punish her. 

Cobel will go on a power trip, thinking that her intervention is what stopped the innies from doing any real damage, so she should get her job back. Milchick will probably become floor supervisor in the interim. Cobel, Milchick, or whoever is put in charge will send the innies to the testing floor to presumably torture them somehow. 

Devon will tell Mark everything, he will be even more driven to find out what is going on and what he meant by “she’s alive”. He will keep working there and work himself into a craze at the slight chance that Gemma is somewhere right out of his reach.

Irving will wake up to Burt opening the door, both of them confused. He seems to be suspicious of everything going on with the severed workers. He will be driven to understand why his innie went to Burt’s house and that will be his main motivation going forward on the outside.

Not sure what is going to happen with Dylan but I don’t think it will work out well for him.

I want them to explore those two, as well as the introduction of red. I think that it can still be subtle while also going into a little more depth, I think something as brief as the microchip lights would be sufficient and wonderful.

People who are little new age-y and say things that _feel_ intelligent to them but aren’t particularly substantive if you think about it. Somebody who might change their name on a whim, or somebody who would miss the practical reason why WWI wasn’t called such at the time. The kind of people that would have a “dinner” without food, instead of just saying they’re hanging out or something.

And then the amazing AMAZING episode.

Didn't give a fuck about so many of the theories and still setting up an amazing story without answering most questions. 

So many amazing things happened in this episode:
&gt;: When he called her Ms. Cobel! I knew we were in for a ride!!

&gt;: Helena Eagan. Holy fuck is she a brilliant individual. If we are supposed to believe the Lexington Letter, your core kinda remains the same? And she puts all of what's happening together so well. Settles in, observes, and realizes that she has that chance to speak to so many people. Also figures out what's happening when Cobel shows up and still manages to get the word in. 
(Although, the whole figuring out where they are and what they can use to find the way forward was done amazingly by all 3 of them! Sort of made it seem like a young adult in an actual adult body story to me...)

&gt;: I was so scared that Cobel had left with the baby. For a second I wanted her to meet with an accident and not make it to the Gala. (which, in hindsight, could have happened if Irv had run the STOP sign like Cobel did.)

&gt;: The complete Irv outie's story! He has been looking into all this for sooo long. Just imagine if he ends up being a reporter who is trying to come up with the ever illusional answer to the question, ""What is it that they are doing down there?""

&gt;: Devon is the best kind of human someone can have around them! Seriously! 
It all started with, ""Our baby!"" She noticed something being off straight away.  
Then made sure she talked to him at the first observation break. 
Somehow listening to the insane story, had the cool to stay in the moment. 
And then actually knowing that journalists would be a better resource to go to, and not the cops. 
She will 100% figure out what ""She's alive!!"" means!!!

&gt;: And of course the amazing hero, who just wants to remember the birth of his child. Who did not give in to the temptation of, ""You've got two more. I'll tell you their names and any perk you want if you let go of the switches!""

And for the line of the episode I'd like to nominate, ""This better be working you assholes""

Bring on Season 2 please.

Devon’s face when Mark told her Cobel was his boss is priceless. She realizes that his company has been secretly surveilling him with a false identity and then that she just handed her baby to her 5 minutes ago. 

Mark’s genuine praise of Ricken’s book having opened up the world for him was so confusing to Ricken. He has a weird friend group that praises him, but he knows Mark wouldn’t have even read it. It’s like his writing is for severed people to learn the nature of their existence.

All of that, combined with outtie Irv trying to map his town, Ricken's friends not seeming to understand basic stuff about WW1, and more, makes me think that the outer world is in fact some strange Eagan-owned stage and that everyone in it is either a victim, severed or not, or part of the ploy.

I find it strange that none of the characters mention out loud that they live in Kier, including Devon.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Does the code scanner actually work?

My guess is no.  My theory is that the severance chip ""tattles"" on employee when deception is detected.  If the employee is nervous about carrying a secret message on their person, the chip detects this nervousness and sends an alert which triggers the ""code detector.""

So, what's the big deal? It's just fluff before introducing Helena, right?

Welcome to KinkoDigby's theory time!

I think Irving's father had something to do with an earlier research project involving severance technology. Irving wants answers about what they did to his father and so took the job at Lumon to try get answers. This would explain the footlocker items &amp; documents and I think this would play well with each character having a strong family connection/story that implicates their work life. Like work/life balance themes etc. - this could be Irving's family component.

i3v8k5i,9,Dangerous-Ad3495,"Ok everyone: 

&gt;! who’s going to get to Reghabi first?!&lt;

Why do I say this? 
So much was affirmed of our theories. Family will expand in the concept of the revolution. 

&gt;!Yes: the Helly-Mark relationship was never meant to be…for now, because the Mark integration after this is going to be seismic. Not only will he RE-focus on Gemma, but also, Cobel &amp; Milchick will debrief Natalie and Jame Eagan (Helly’s dad, current CEO) - so our group is heading down to the testing floor in S2. !&lt;

&gt;!Burt won’t necessarily answer the door in time of S2 - but - Irving just showing up will clearly tip Burt to get out of Kier &amp; be the outside lead on the innies revolt. The key: does oBurt know about Reghabi? What’s with Irv’s map - he knows A LOT as an outie &amp; might have already built on Petey’s work as a part of the “they” with Reghabi.!&lt;

&gt;!Devon will now join that with Ricken. B
Cobel will try to shut that angle (and all the angle’s) down - so the key here will be: what does Cobel/selvig &amp; Milchick NOT know?
• they won’t know iMark told Devin Gemma is alive!&lt;

&gt;!Will Dylan turn now knowing he has 3 kids? Or, will he persevere through temptation undefined here to be revealed and stay on the revolution team. What will that mean for him as Milchick TO THIS POINT hasn’t told Cobel he did the OTC in the first place?!&lt;

&gt;!What will Jame &amp; Natalie do now that an innie Helly has spoken? They can silence the media, but someone will be impacted by what iHelly said ever so briefly, regardless of Cobel &amp; Natalie. Key: who exactly &amp; toward which why?!&lt;

PERFECT FINALE. &gt;!Hey kids, what’s for dinner is that Irv will be the key to connecting Petey &amp; Gemma’s experiences, with Burt, to Reghabi &amp; Petey’s “very long answer”. Devon &amp; Ricken may be the voucher messengers to the rest of the “world”. !&lt;

&gt;!Helly: confirmation &amp; Mark notwithstanding - will Helena no longer wake her up once Natalie &amp; Jane tell her she was compromised? Is there a loophole Helly can quickly exploit to stay in the revolution - or - is this now all on Mark, Irv &amp; Dylan?!&lt;

&gt;!We didn’t get the goat connection &amp; I am SO happy we didn’t. Nor other interesting questions (that I am now fully confident will be connected by the Seversnve team).!&lt;

Season 2 will have Lumon in massive cover up mode, obviously.

With Helly obviously they will find a way to play it off, if they don’t that’s a wrap on the series. As we’ve learned recently in politics if senators are involved the stakes are high.

The setting is in Kier with Kier license plates so there is a high level of believability that they have media control as well. 

Dylan has unbelievable stakes because he’s been told about his family without being able to validate any information. It’s possible he’s a single father with just the one kid. But they could leverage his entire family against him as he was the only one who didn’t get a longer view into his life.

&gt; Following ""Severance"" for the past two months as each weekly episode drops reminds you of just how wonderful it is to witness things as they unfold for the first time. Well-cast, brilliantly-directed and edited, with one of the most spellbinding opening sequences in the recent TV history, ""Severance"" is the perfect blend of Sci-fi, mystery, dystopia, and dark comedic undertones. ""Black Mirror"" is the only comparison that comes to mind but that show falls under the anthology category, therefore ""Severance"" is quite unlike any TV series you've ever seen before. As the mystery unfolds, you can't help but think about the layers upon layers of possibilities and various implications. Each episode takes its time in developing its textured characters, positioning you for a satisfying payoff. Every actor stands out in their own right, from the lead Adam Scott to veterans Patricia Arquette, John Torturo, Christopher Walken to Tramell Tillman as ""Milchick,"" my personal favorite.

i3vfzyn,9,SharkBaitDLS,"To add to what the other person said in more detail:

Westworld S1 did an incredible job of worldbuilding and storytelling through deliberate detail and mystery. Every plot twist felt earned and paid off well because there was very well-placed and subtle foreshadowing that you could find on a rewatch or look back on in retrospect.

However, the showrunners got upset that people on the internet figured out some of the twists before they aired, so for S2 they deliberately changed the plot away from what they had planned for the sole purpose of making it sufficiently confusing that people wouldn't figure out their twists ahead of time.

This had the consequence of making said twists feel unearned and the storytelling more jarring, since you no longer had sufficient information to look back on in retrospect to justify them. It became surprises for the sake of surprise rather than them being earned. It was no longer this super polished and coherent world, but instead just became another TV drama. Not bad in any way, but S1 was damn near a masterpiece so it was a major regression by comparison. S1 is easily one of my favorite pieces of television content of all time while the subsequent seasons were just 7/10 forgettable TV.",28,1649404114,212

I feel like the Lumon bigwigs have a big stake in not just claiming innies are happy, but in believing it.  Otherwise, why teach them all this Kier philosophy and so on?

And since Kier is all about (his hubristic spin on) the Protestant work ethic, it doesn't make a lot of sense for his heirs to believe the people doing the work are not ""real people"".  They should be buying into their own BS.  So obviously Helena was confronted with the reality of her innie's deep unhappiness, but ISTM she would have responded by saying something like ""I understand you're unhappy, but please understand this is all for the greater good, and you and I are a team"", something like that.

i3vmlaa,9,ReggieLeBeau,"Holy shit, what an incredible show! I started it last week and the wait to this finale was unbearable (but I'm glad I didn't need to wait week to week for each episode to come out) I kept counting the minutes left and feeling dread seeing the end of the episode getting closer. But they ended it at the perfect moment to have that cliffhanger ending while still feeling like they resolved some plot threads. If it had ended on a more ambiguous note, it would have been pretty disappointing. 

I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but it was cool to see the entire episode play out with the innie's trying to figure things out on the outside. I thought they might have only been out for a few minutes and then their time would get cut short much sooner, with the rest of the episode dealing with the aftermath of that. This was far more tense and stressful to watch than I anticipated. I probably should have stayed away from reddit because the Helly Eagan reveal sort of got ""spoiled,"" and that might have been a little more surprising to see, but then again, maybe not. Given the way the previous episode ends and the way Helly's outie treats her, the reveal almost feels inevitable at that point. 

The wait for season 2 is going to be hell, but hopefully whatever they come up with next lives up to the first season because it's a pretty high bar they've set for themselves. And I hope this is a show that they have a solid endgame in mind for, and not something they plan on running for too many seasons.

Yes, that's why coming back would be weird! Outie Mark will know that his innie is miserable, that Lumon is doing something very weird, and that his wife is alive (at least in some sense). He can accomplish far more outside than inside. The logical next step is reintegration and confronting Cobel.

&gt; She's an Eagan,,no matter how much they bury helly's words, quitting from Lumon would be bad PR, they need helly to work at Lumon for their plans to succeed

Outie Helly would risk life and limb by coming back – now that innie Helly has done a lot of damage she might be fine with punishing outie Helly and ending her misery in one stroke. Lumon can lie about Helly still working on the severed floor. Besides keeping the innie alive after she announced that they're tortured and miserable seems like much worse PR than simply quitting.

Wow. What an incredible, marvelously shot and scripted, masterpiece of a finale. Didn’t go the way we were expecting aside from Helly being an Eagan and Mark choosing to confide in Devon. Some massive cliffhangers that beg some questions:

1.	⁠Dylan vs. Milchick - I predict Dylan will bash him in the head witch the holographic crystal gift. If not, Dylan may go to the testing room to have his memory wiped or just get wrecked in the break room for an ungodly amount of time.
2.	⁠Helly’s speech ending with her being pulled off stage after telling the audience the innies are tortured - she will be branded as crazy, psychotic, that it was all made up, and the Lumon party attendees (aside from maybe a few) will go along with thinking she’s a nutjob and continue being pro-severance
3.	⁠Irving immediately going to search for Burt - loved it. Although he was sad to see that Burt already has another male partner, he still got to see the love of his life. I love that oBurt is gay too.
4.	⁠Irv turning to outie Irv while banging on Burt’s door - heartbreaking. He’s either going to be confused and humiliated when Burt opens the door, or Burt may remember him, even if only that Irv looks familiar. I always had a feeling Irv’s story would end up being tragic.
5.	⁠Mark realizing Cobel has infiltrated his life and family. This is huge and will play a large role in the sharing of information between cobel, Devon, and outie Mark.
6.	⁠Mark screaming “SHE’S ALIVE!!!” after seeing the picture of Gemma - This will be taken by partygoers and perhaps Devon and Milchick as Eleanor being alive. Perhaps someone will find the wedding picture moves or turned over and realize who he’s talking about. (Edit - I’ve been informed he was holding the picture of Gemma when he said this. Must’ve missed it?)
7.	⁠Cobel stopping Helly - her warning to her that the others will suffer gravely  if she goes through with then speech. This makes me believe she will be a good guy in the end. She may worship Kier, but is no longer loyal to Lumon and has no reason to do things for the good of the company. Notice that she goes straight for Helly rather than the severance floor to help Milchick stop Dylan. Idk. I just really don’t see her as a classic bad guy at the end of all of this. Otherwise she wouldn’t have been encouraging mark to quit at the end of ep8.
8. Dylan finding out he has more children. If he makes it to the next season, he is going to do whatever he can to get to his family. 
9. Kinda concerned that they’re going to wipe all the current innies’ memories. That would make the plot of season 3 all about Devon, Rickon, and oMark (and possibly the partygoers, plus maybe a few at the gala that believed Helly’s speech) trying to find a way to stop/overthrow Lumon.
10. Mark is in no way returning to Lumon unless it’s to help the rest of MDR. After Devon relays what his inner told her, I think he’ll spend his time on the outside trying to contact the rest of MDR and Burt - perhaps Reghabi will come into play here and the season will be all about reintegration and trying to create an uprising.",3,1649416360,577

Seems like something is up with the friends though. Yes they are poking fun at a certain type, but it is exaggerated to the point of absurdity. And it seems like a lot of important plot elements started out as comical absurdities- melon bars, musical dance,  experience, egg bar are (maybe) just photo ops for oHelly’s book. Ms. Casey as a comically bizarre wellness counselor turning out to be Gemma (I bet “enjoy each fact equally” will be significant beyond the humor). Waffle parties and Eagan cult mysticism or whatever.

That was really interesting for me to explore, and, also, it spoke to the world and the tone of the show because you never knew what was going to happen. 

&gt;	I felt that Milchick embodies this unexpected energy, this creepy energy — an energy where you want to trust him, and you should trust him, but you definitely don't want to cross him, creating an atmosphere where he's a little off kilter, like you said, that creepy smile. He has this really great smile, but it's a little bit off.

The leaders of the cult, including the Eagan family, understand that Severance isn’t good, but they use it as a means to an end.

In other words, the cult leaders want everyone outside the cult to believe Severance is good, but that doesn’t mean the cult leaders themselves believe it is.

Lumon knows a lot about the brain, but not everything. While there may be an attempt to do a wipe and reset, the underlying memories and personality could still be hidden away and accessible. I think that’s part of Irving’s story, and why he is able to paint pictures of the hallway to the break room.

As lab rats, the innies are too valuable to just cast aside without trying to manipulate them back into obedience. It would be a breakthrough if Lumon figured out how to correct a wayward innie. It’s almost biblical — the ability to have your past life of sins or whatever wiped clean, but not erasing fallibility that is inherent to being human. 

But religion is a man-made creation. Lumon recognizes that there is an evolutionary basis for a follow-the-leader impulse, which religious leaders have exploited for power. What if Lumon’s end game is to thwart evolution, by temporarily controlling human impulses, as a way for them to achieve global power. 

This makes religion and the cult aspects a means to an end, but not the overall goal of the family and corporation.

I hope aliens or the supernatural never become part of the story, maybe other than a constructed way to manipulate the innies by playing on popular notions of what aliens can do to people.",2,1649422973,255

I get the reasoning, if nobody has been killed yet the buzz can be about 'who will die' but if you do kill someone then the buzz is 'what happens now' which is often way more effective.

The article called the finale episode ""flabbergasting"" and ""spectacular."" The interviewer said ""The finale is one of the most tense, spellbinding, shocking hours of television I've ever seen.""

Creator Dan Erickson didn't say the final ep ""wasn't the writer's original envisioned ending for the season."" He didn't mention the writers at all. He did say he'd imagined a 10th episode with more of a pay-off, but he applauded Ben Stiller for making the right call on not revealing too much too soon:

&gt;**I have to give a lot of credit to Ben Stiller** because, in addition to being one of the best working directors, he has a great sense of story. He was very bold in saying, ""We're not going to rush this. There are going to be people who want more answers sooner than we will provide them.” 

I also resent the suggestion that people who enjoyed the episode were simply ""satisfied with the adrenaline rush."" You can get adrenaline rushes anywhere. You can't find finely-crafted stories everywhere, or well-written characters, or mind-bending themes that aren't inherently ridiculous. This episode did all of those things well. A lot of things were achieved, and there are a lot of new things to think about.

Those inherent personality traits in outie form often belong to leaders, visionaries, powerful people. 
But on the flip side of that coin, when someone behaves in those same ways when they AREN’T in a position of power, they can be labeled as unhinged or crazy - their innie forms are seen as lesser-than a person and marginalized. So the inherent personality traits that carry over from outie to innie manifest themselves differently, based on their “status” as innie vs. outie. And those same identical personality traits are assigned a different value when viewed by others depending on whether you’re an outie (privileged) or an innie (marginalized).

It's also fairly common to ""get all that stuff back and recreate it a few months from now."" They do that literally all the time in the TV industry. They have staff whose sole purpose is to record everything for continuity and recreate sets and scenes from scratch. The sets they created just go into storage and are wheeled out the next time they need them. The extras are quite happy to turn up for another pay-day. They ""set up the cameras"" at the beginning of every day regardless of where they're filming. That's how this stuff works.",3,1649425198,152

It's also empowering though, because looking in the mirror she sees Helena Eagan, not Helly R, and she's forcing Helena to make an apology in the way that she was forced to make one.

Fuck, every episode of this show ends on the biggest cliffhangers and now we have to sit on it for a year. There's just too much for me to process from this episode alone, let alone all the unresolved mysteries all season. Not to mention, I watched this after watching Everything Everywhere All at Once *twice*. I don't think the brain is meant to withstand this amount of mindfuckery in one day.

This show is so damn smart and it knows exactly how to stretch the tension, much like Dylan holding those switches for an hour. Kudos to all those who predicted that Helly was an Eagan (I'm still trying to figure out what the R. stands for). I don't remember how people originally came to that conclusion; was it just because of how cold her outie was behaving towards her innie, or was there another clue within the early episodes?

The scene with Mark at the party was masterfully done. I liked how he was able to gather so much intel without arousing too much suspicion (besides the Ms. Cobel slip!). I loved how his sister also accepted it and put it all together. I'm dying because the knowledge that Gemma is Ms. Casey is such a huge bombshell for his innie to process. The fact that it cuts off after ""SHE'S ALIVE"" leads me to think that it won't be enough information for anyone else to go on. Meanwhile, I hope Helly was able to say enough without the Eagans being able to cover up the truth. I'm also so disappointed that Cobel is still loyal to Lumon and Milchick even after being sacked, since she could have made a great ally to Mark.

Since Irving had no one to tell about Lumon, I wish he wrote a detailed note to his outie about what was going on and what he was doing. It's going to be strange when his outie finds himself outside of Burt's residence, and I highly doubt Burt will have any lingering memories of him either. Although it's interesting to note that the innies still retain the part of the brain that knows how to drive. Kind of like riding a bike, it's one of those learned traits you inherently carry.

I'm still very confused about the ""two person system"" that is required for Overtime Contingency. How was Milchick able to release Dylan at his house (and physically be there at the same time), while Dylan has to hold both switches on at the same time? We know that Milchick was working alone, so is there a mobile version of that unit he was using? I can't remember if this was already addressed in a previous episode.

By the way, do we know why Patricia Arquette was sometimes credited as ""Peggy"" in some early articles and interviews? I thought there might be another left turn coming up, but maybe it's a twist better left for another day.",3,1649426410,495

He worked out who his sister was and waited until they were alone.

That's a really bizarre take. They all did, or made every effort to do, exactly what they said they would. Helly spoke out against severance in front of a crowd at Lumon.

I wish we found out a little bit more about Irv and Burt. Harmony is not good. Dylan and Helly are heroes. Devon will be the key person on the outside to get to the bottom of what’s going on next season and I can totally see her and Mrs Selvig coming to fisticuffs.",7,1649428837,142

i3wqqps,9,jordan3119,One thing I really like about this show is rarely do you ever get a real good sense of space. Everything is just amorphous. The only thing we ever really see clearly is the Lumon building from the outside. The building and the parking lot. Everything else is (aside from maybe Mark’s house to some extent) is not explored or articulated visually in such a way as to give you some comfort in knowing where the “walls” are in a sense. Sort of like the same deal with The Shining. Its physically consuming layout lends to keeping the viewer unsettled. We’re left kind of wondering where the limits of each environment are. It’s this really great way to emphasize the maze-like feeling that the show has. Like the basement level of Lumon. It’s keeping us like rats in a maze.,16,1649430395,140

As far as the dude in the server room - that is Dylan - the override switches them from outie to innie so, their work/home life is still partitioned. Also, the severed employees were not told this was an option when they signed up.

Lumon is trying to release Severance as a service / product for other companies. They try to brand it as a safe, humane, and progressive treatment that has only benefits. 

What are the severed people doing down there? They're being tested. They're the beta testers for the Severance project. They receive coded stimuli (""scary numbers"") which they have to respond to. They get indoctrinated with Kier's self-important bullshit writing and the lionization of his life. They receive meaningless rewards.

* Kier the town is obviously a company town, so why does anyone else live here? There has to be a good reason why anyone else is here. 
* I think Ricken is severed and he doesn't know it. He's so weird because he's a permanent innie. I think severance has a subconscious effect on him, which leads to his writing. Part of him knows the world doesn't work the way it appears to work, but he can't consciously wrap his head around it so he struggles to explain it with seaweed rituals and odd self-help writing.
* I also think Ricken's friends are severed. I think they're awkward because they haven't lived full lives to become well-adjusted. 
* It's highly possible that most of the town residents in Kier are severed. The word ""kier"" is literally ""a vat"" so I think the entire town is an experimentation space for Lumon. 
* It's possible that the severance procedure can not only fork the mind, but bring with it implanted memories or someone else's consciousness entirely. 
* Kier(?) Eagan himself talks about his ""revolving"" and I think we're looking at a Get Out situation (or a FMA:B Greed situation, if you're a weeb). The company is probably on edge about the possibility of reintegration because that would be a major problem if someone else's consciousness had taken over a body. 
* Lots of names on the list of Lumon employees were involved in ""car crashes"" so we know that's total bullshit. We know it's extra bullshit for Gemma. So how is Lumon actually getting people? Is it a grab-and-bag situation? Blackmail? I refuse to believe Gemma joined willingly. 
* If severance *can* implant memories or alter them, then it's possible Mark *didn't* join Lumon because of Gemma and they got him in some other way to experiment on the two of them, seeing if severance was powerful enough to erase a strong marriage. 
* Why is Harmony so desperate to get back to Lumon? Why is she a true believer? Something doesn't add up, especially when it comes to that hospital bracelet.",3,1649438719,355

i3xukji,9,KatetCadet,"My personal theory:

**Both Mark and his sister are both Kier direct descendants.**

Possibly everyone who lives in the town they live in as well. They are all either aware that they are, are currently experiencing severance and don't know they are, or are currently actors (cult members / employees) filling in the spaces for their lives.

A couple of things that support this:

* A key line in this episode was spoken by the woman who was introduced to Helly. She mentions that she just had her third child and ""**thank god for severance**"". Meaning, pregnant women are using severance in order to not experience the burden and pain of child birth. I believe Mark's sister is an Eagan using severance to skip being pregnant, having the child, and even skipping breast feeding due to the inconvenience of it. I'm willing to bet Mark's ""sister"" as he knows her will be killed.
* Mark's sister seems to be surrounded by people that are extremely strange. This could be just the tone of the show, but I personally believe it is because they are either actors/employees, and know who she really is. This would explain why the strange guy runs into the room yelling that he found the baby so desperately, maybe he thinks this will somehow work in his favor despite it being her ""innie""? It would explain his desperation for acceptance not for the husband, but for her. He also seems to think Mark is still ""in there"" and will have some remembrance of what happens while he is experiencing severance.
* This could also explain why the same guest also suggested that they should delay ""introducing the child until after the event tonight"". This was directly after they were complaining about Ricken's book having ""no thesis"". I think they know this baby is going to be an important figure, and didnt want to introduce the baby during a terrible book reading. They know Mark has sway over his sister so they came to him.
* That would also explain the relationship the sister had with the other mother. The other mother knew she was talking to someone severed, higher up in the cult. She was terrified and was not severed herself.
* Mark's wife is not dead. She also just so happens to be working in the office in which Mark works as well. I believe Mark and his sister believe she is dead because for whatever reason, Mark and his wife had to be separated. Whether that was due to divorce and just wanting to think each other were dead, or because someone at the company didnt want Mark living out his life with her / being influenced her for whatever reason, I think the ""outie"" Mark that we know is actually another severed Mark. A Mark that was fabricated to keep him away from his wife. Whoever severed his sister implanted the same memory of her dying. Whether that was done by the ""real"" Mark or Lumon's board I am not sure, but I would imagine it is the later.
* Irving's map was specifically from the company, and it actually didnt seem to be that large. As in I dont think they are in a country owned by the corp, but rather a town / cult compound that is the heart of the company. Lumon's most elite and highest level workers work in the city. I believe Mark's wife is actually not an Eagan (maybe the reason she had to be removed?) which is why she is sent back down a floor and just in general is treated differently. Maybe Eagan's inbreed lol
* With how much almost creepy godlike admiration Ms Cobel has for Mark, I think Mark is actually a direct descendent of Lumon's founder and it would explain why his sister is also so important. I don't have any evidence to support this besides Ms Cobel, who only has a similar tone of admiration when she is at her shrine.

Her “car accident” was a result of her innie getting out of control and Lumon had to reign her in. And that explains why she’s being so tortured now. What Cobel said to Shelly right before the speech alludes to this as the other innies’ fate as well.

One, Milchick is literally the only person left in management. Judd, the security guard that is *sometimes* seated at the exits for the elevator, is seemingly rarely paying attention even when he’s there. In fact, I’ve wondered if he’s there for only Mark for some yet-to-be-known reason. He wasn’t even there when Helly hanged herself. There’s something amiss with that (even if you consider she’s an Eagen). 

Secondly, even on regular days when Dylan hasn’t broken into it, that security room is always empty. In order for an alarm to be seen or heard about an employee failing to leave, you gotta have a person there to see or hear it. Dylan was the only one in there at the time. 

Finally, Milchick tells Dylan that the four tempers (the dancers at the waffle party) are still there and he can get him back in with them to finish the party if he’ll just let Milchick in the security room. We don’t know if that’s true or if it’s just bait to get him inside but we do know that there is likely an expectation that Dylan was going to spend a lot more time inside that party. I think we can all agree sex with those people is expected. So, it’s not unreasonable to think that they weren’t expecting Dylan to leave for quite a while.

i3z1ri5,9,ontic00,"So Helly was an Eagan! I agreed early on that she was clearly important at Lumon, but I remained skeptical that she was an Eagan. The main thing that threw me off is that everyone's innie names seemed to be a shortened version of their real first name followed by the last letter of their real last name. I wonder if there is a deeper meaning behind the ""R"" in Helly R, then, or if it is just a middle name initial, a married name initial (her outie clearly still goes by Helena Eagan, but with how dominant the Eagan's are it is likely that whoever an Eagan marries has to take their name, so maybe R is the first letter of a spouse's former last name), or even just randomly added since ""Helly E"" sounds weird. 

Also, I was unsure whether Cobel would want to help them or turn them in to get back into Lumon's good graces. I initially thought my second idea was right, but thinking back on it (eventually I need to re-watch this whole season), I'm undecided. She seemed talking to Helly at the end like she might be concerned what Lumon would do to Helly and her friends if Helly went against them, like maybe she has experience with Lumon having done something horrible to a loved one of hers (Charlotte Cobel perhaps?) and is trying to stop that same fate from befalling Helly, Mark, Irv, and Dylan. Or maybe she just wanted to stop Helly to protect Lumon, it is hard to say. I think Cobel/Ms. Selvig is my favorite character in the show - her motivations are so obscure and it is difficult to know if she is good or bad.

Lastly, my new theory is that Lumon is trying to expand the severance chip's functionality and have everyone chipped to effectively control everyone. It seems Helly's father was the one who invented the chip (based on his conversation with her about how he showed her the prototype when she was young), and he mentioned wanting everyone to be safe and Helena's decision to be severed seems to have been a public relations stint. Based off the list of commands in the security office, I think the chips can do far more than just split memories into multiple blocks, and I think the point of Lumon is that they will sell the severance chips as a way to get through bad experiences without remembering them, but once they are implanted they will essentially have a huge amount of control over people. Everything they are doing I think is working on improving the chip. I initially thought Gemma/Ms. Casey wasn't likely to be in a coma, but now I am thinking maybe she is an experiment - maybe the car accident put Gemma in a coma, and they are trying to see how well the severance chip can work to sort of bring almost-dead people ""back to life"". If this is the case it could lead to a conclusion of this sort of love triangle Mark sees himself in with Gemma/Ms. Casey and Helly. Presumably Mark, Helly, Dylan, and Irv will want to end up destroying the severance technology, and Mark will realize that it means essentially killing his wife since the only way she is not in a coma is with Ms. Casey, but he will come to terms with Gemma being gone and realize he could move on with Helly.",2,1649463666,579

Absolutely everything inside of the fake state of PE and the fake town of Kier is part of a social engineering and mind conditioning experiment. There may have been an Eagan family early in the days of the company, but the Eagan mythos is a fake religion cooked up for brainwashing purposes. Its very likely that the person portraying her father in the scene, who was theoretically the current CEO of Lumon, Jame Eagan, is also another severed individual who is simply playing that role in the scenario. What Lumon is doing is setting some initial experimental parameters, putting various players with various characteristics in place, and then letting the scenario play out. In this case they want to know what would happen in a socially controlled circumstance where a strong willed, unbroken ego, say for example the daughter of the current CEO, were thrown into the mix. They facilitated all the conditions for the innies to stage a breakout And let it roll. There is no loss to them regardless of the outcome since all the players are nothing but severed bodies playing a role that has been assigned to them, including all the guests of the gala, Natalie, Cobel etc.

i3z3r2e,9,[deleted],"Just watched the finale again, and still reeling.

First of all, give it up for Dylan who held that pose for 45 minutes? Maybe less? I don’t think I could have held it for 5! 

Helly and Helena are both cold hearted ice queens willing to undergo the severance procedure and willing to risk her friends lives after being threatened by Cobel. The first time watching I thought she might not go through with it and then the second watch it was clear that she does not fucking back down. Kudos to her for keeping it together while the OTC kicked in at a gala in her honor. I think any of the other characters would not have been able to pull that off and wait for the exact right moment.

Mark played it well too, but he was so deferential it killed me. He got the job done including telling his sister She’s Alive!!! I have so many questions about this Gemma situation. Does she not have an outie? If she does have an outie, was her entire memory erased or is she hiding from Mark for some reason? Did she fake her own death with Lumon’s help or did Lumon do it to her, and why?? It also shows how much influence Lumon has on this town if they were able to pull that off.

Irv had the most interesting story because he and his outie seemed to be so in sync! His outie remembered that hallway with the elevator and seemed to have prepared for his innie. His innie seemed to know where to look for information in that hidden drawer inside a chest in a closet. He went right to it! Has this happened to Irv before?? Yet, while he seems to be able to communicate with himself through his subconscious his outie seems so different from his innie- heavy metal does not seem like Irving B’s first choice.

So I'm not sure if she was trying to stop Helly and Dylan primarily out of concern for what Lumon would do to them, or primarily out of concern for the damage they would cause Lumon.

The immediate question is, what happens to Dylan. There's likely going to be some sort of permanent retirement there, unless he manages to cave in Milchick's skull with the glass block.

I think the severance simply retains a lot of those core qualities of the person, but they're a little more ""refined"" and filtered because they don't have the external experience that manifests and influences those qualities in positive or negative ways. Outie Mark isn't really a cynical pessimist at his core. He's actually very caring and supportive (he clearly cares for his sister and at the very least tolerates his brother-in-law), but he's also a deeply broken person dealing with the loss of his best friend (Gemma). Innie Mark is caring and supportive as well, and he's also coming to terms with the loss of his best friend (Petey). Outie Dylan we don't really know much about but can deduce that he's likely a decent father, so he's a family man it would seem. Innie Dylan, as much as he maybe comes across as an instigator, is ultimately incredibly loyal and generous to his work ""family"" and the entire finale is a testament to that. Outie Irv is another one who we don't quite have a complete picture of yet, but he comes across as gentle to me and the potential military background suggests he's also a man of discipline in some sense (or at least, he was at some point in his life). Innie Irv is also gentle and disciplined. The most interesting dynamic is, of course, Helly. ""Helena"" is a very stubborn person who's willing to do anything to accomplish her goals, it would seem. Helly R is exactly the same as her outtie in that regard, but what's interesting is that Helly R is the one that shows empathy, whereas Helena does not. So whatever experience Helena is having on the outside is suppressing that capacity to have empathy, but it's obviously still part of her deep down because it's part of Helly R.",9,1649469113,309

I think they’re creating artificial human bodies on the testing floor and implanting them with used severance chips to give them the same memories/personality of the person who previously had the chip in their brain. That’s my theory  on what happened to Gemma as well. She died in the accident, but they were able to remove her chip and implant what little of her personality was in it in a new artificial body grown as part of Lumon’s testing. The only part of this that doesn’t pan out is how she had a chip in her in the first place. Maybe she was secretly working at Lumon without Mark knowing?

Maybe this is what the entire testing floor is and the ultimate game plan. They mentioned permanent innies earlier in the season. Could those be artificially grown bodies brought to life using a severance chip removed either from a retired or dead worker? Maybe all the work they’re doing at Lumon is slowly downloading bits of their memories and personalities into the chip itself. 

Maybe this is what “revolving” is, except in the case of Helena’s father, he’s going to have it permanently done to him for the first time in history by harvesting the chip from his current dying body and having it put into a healthy artificial body so he can effectively be immortal. The revolving would make it permanent instead of the “test drive” he was going on during the last episode to be at his daughter’s speech. His weirdly waxy face and body might’ve been the artificially grown body while his real body is sick and disabled in his bed. It seems like at this stage, the artificial bodies with chip brains are only able to walk around and function for a few hours at a time, hence Ms. Casey’s only working a few hours at a time, with 8 straight hours as a maximum.",1,1649476272,340

The three would have had hours and hours to make plans on what to do and would have realized they would not be able to go indefinitely, yet they have no sense of urgency!  I mean they all act completely stupid and lackadaisical about their situation.  Helly is the only character that is truly in a situation out of her depth so that she can't hurry or do anything.  They tried to do that with Mark, but he never looks for a phone or writing implements or anything to help himself or even ""sister, this is important and it can't wait.""  Yes, I realize the counter point to that is that he just playing the subservient worker innie, except that innie is also cautious borne out of paranoia, which guess what he suddenly isn't paranoid when he says Mrs. Cobel's name, hmmm.

It's possible that this has all been gone over already, and I apologize if so. I didn't want to read anything about the show until I got caught up, so I haven't looked back through posts much yet. But the things that strike me about Ricken:

- He's almost *too* on point in his dippy self-affirmation, new-age guru persona. And sometimes he has moments of self-awareness that slip out that seem too out of character for someone like that.
- His book is almost exactly counter to everything Lumon teaches, of course, but more importantly, it's written in such a childlike and ridiculously simplistic way as to appeal and speak effectively to unsophisticated and childlike innies damn near perfectly. It's also dumb enough to be easily dismissed by anyone well-educated or serious. Hiding in plain sight.
- It's bugged me why Kobel stole the book from Mark's porch and kept it. Why would they have cared?
- He has a visceral dislike of severance, but still seems sympathetic to the severed. He seems to genuinely care about Mark.
- He spoke of not wanting to be like his father and it was clear it was distressing (this one may be a bit of a reach).
- Red hair, like Helly.
- Lastly, how the heck did someone as smart and chill and generally sensible as Devon end up with someone like Rickon? Odd couple at the very least. But being where he is, so close to Lumon and everything going on, is interesting.",20,1649480425,287

Wouldn't retaining Gemma's actual name strengthen the experiment, rather than weaken it? If he failed to recognize her even with her real name, that would be even stronger proof the chips work. Helly's last name change is a deception that makes perfect contextual sense: everyone inside, including the severed workers, knows about the Eagans and are trained to venerate them.

Well, what if goats in the Severance universe are a race of hyperintelligent, possibly alien creatures (like dolphins in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) who want to take over the human race. Kier Eagan discovered this, and decided to create Lumon to try to turn the human race into obedient servants of the goats. It would explain the goats and Kier's seeming fascination with goats and pagan mythology (no doubt he thought the hyperintelligent goats are some sort of mythical gods). Oh, and who are the board and why do they only communicating through speaker? Maybe the board is comprised of goats, so they don't want to give themselves away by issuing orders in the flesh.

Because she wasn't confident that severance was as foolproof as claimed. She was trying to work out, the whole time, whether Outtie Mark had any knowledge of Innie Mark and vice versa.

She also had to have a neighborly persona, albeit a weird one, because there's no way Mark and his sister would forge a friendly, chatty relationship with Harmony ""don't make me throw my mug at you"" Cobel.",3,1649491796,82

But it's possible that (a) they won't all go back to work, or (b) they will but their memories will be reset in some way (I think the writers would proceed very cautiously with this one, because it would be really frustrating for viewers to see them go back to square one), or (c) some other scenario we haven't thought of.

Keep in mind that no matter what happens to the innies, Innie Mark was able to communicate with Devon, so Devon can now share that information with Outtie Mark. So they have gained ground that can't be lost.",2,1649492133,183

You're not factoring in how disorienting this would be for them. Remember when they went to O&amp;D and Helly said ""This is more people than I've ever seen?"" There were about 7 people there. Suddenly she's in a room with 50 people and there are photos of her everywhere.

They're virtual children who wake up in a place totally unfamiliar to them surrounded by people they don't know and they have to get their bearings, work out what to do, find a trustworthy person, and tell them everything. If Mark had acted with a sense of urgency, he would have told everything to the friendly lady with the grey hair who kept quizzing him about his life. Mark is not that stupid. 

He could have grabbed Ricken by the arm, told him to forget about the neti pot and spilled the beans then and there, but even Ricken wasn't the right person. Devon was the right person. 

The other thing you haven't factored in is how quickly it all actually happened. It felt like a long time to us, especially as we were watching four separate stories concurrently, but in fact it all happened fairly quickly. Follow Helly, for example: she went in an elevator, had a brief chat with the senator and his wife, looked at the pictures of herself, then went to the bathroom  for a few minutes.

It’s like the innies who know nothing of the real world or any world other than lumon, and finding ricken’s book (the only other philosophy besides lumon cult shit they’ve ever been exposed to) that they change so might. 

I think it’s also commentary on how people who are so high up in the food chain, like CEOs and their children have zero understanding of what their workers actually do and when they say that their workers are family, it’s just lip service and it means nothing.

Assuming that doesn't happen...

Outie Mark has no idea Cobel knows he woke up. And they said they can't go to the police (because of Lumon's influence) so maybe he will try to go back to the office, in order to keep a low profile while investigating. 

Irv's outie will wake up banging on the door, not knowing why he's there specifically. But he will understand that he woke up and went to one of the houses marked on his map, so will know Burt G is someone his innie knows. But does he have any reason not to go back to work?

That sets up a scenario where Lumon have Mark, Helly, Dylan and maybe Irv. So maybe their innies all get wiped? Maybe they torture Mark to get innie Helly to tell the world that the innies are all happy after all?",3,1649496628,184

You go through the severance procedure once and the chip is activated to switch from the innie to the outie, like when the MDR employees get on and off the elevator each day.

But what good is a planet of Kier loyalists? A workforce? An army? A bunch of clients for waffle parties?

Helly:Firestarter on the inside.Firestarter in the outside.It seems personality traits arent severed.I am surprised she waited the two minutes to speak instead of just storming the stage.100% chance they will edit out what she said tho.

Irv:All those investigator theories should have been pointed at you.As we see  him being a military man who sticks to the rules probably bled thru to his innie being a company man.They did stretch things a bit with him being able to drive and follow a map.Half of gen Z probably couldnt follow a paper map today.Aside from that I liked his silent reveals.

Gemma could very well be gone/brain dead, and I think Ms Casey could be AI on a chip.

So your conclusion is built on an assumption that could easily be proven false later in the show.

I say this show brought those feelings though, because Lumon has its hands in the political world. A company that doesn’t play by the rules of nature, the religious-like reverence for the history of the family..

The entire flaw in their thinking is assuming that predictability is a bad thing. The people going over your material with a fine-toothed comb *should* be able to accurately predict things. That means you’ve created an internally consistent universe with accurate details to what’s actually going on. If you attempt to remove predictability you break that internal consistency and make your twists feel forced and unearned.

For example, imagine if at the end of this season of Severance it turned out Helly was just a random nobody. That would feel cheap and unearned, invalidating all the details we’ve seen throughout the season that suggested she was for *some reason* unordinary and important to Lumon beyond her immediate role.

So what if outside of the town and outside all this (on the phone calls) are the admins of said simulation?

You follow me? What they’re doing at work is severing everyone’s simulated consciousnesses from their ‘cloned’ real life minds that are outside the sim!? Literally, Mark and co’s job with the #’s is somehow clipping or adjusting the code of their consciousness — so that they’re severed from reality?? 

Oh shit, as I’m typing it… it makes me think  — maybe ‘severance’ and the whole shows concept of being severed has NOTHING to do with what we’ve been shown. **Perhaps they’re more like the ‘egg consciousness’ from the black mirror Christmas special with Jon Hamm - ‘White Christmas’!**

Maybe severance is severing them from their human self/consciousness… so that they can be used for whatever business or personal purposes — i.e.: use of the ‘admins’. The admins would be their owners; or more likely — they’re the company that owns this product and are prepping it for sale. 

**Think about the gala/Lumon demonstration &amp; party**: perhaps the guests are plugged/jacked into the sim and this is some kind of demo to showcase to the investors that they can split off these chunks of consciousness, where they have these nested simulations and nested consciousnesses. Who better to demo this to investors and so forth than by then the daughter of the CEO/owner. That would make me feel more comfortable about extracting a flash clone of my consciousness that I could then potentially use to get work done for me — or even closer to base reality — to have a baby for my wife!

Severed coded humans that can get X work done for you”! The marketing behind it is that they don’t remember anything of what it’s like the be human or anything regarding their past life. But they’re efficient humans (not AI, but a REAL ‘human’ to achieve the owners goals — work etc).

So think of WHITE CHRISTMAS - the black mirror episode. Where they extract the consciousness from the owner and put it in a small egg. And the ‘egg’ version of the person (so sad) — Their WHOLE JOB and ENTIRE existence is to then prepare toast and the owners daily task list, play alarms for them, open their blinds and so on.

Do you follow my train of thought here? I was just trying to put things in perspective; my idea of them being some kind of digital/coded units in a simulation…. And they get severed from their prior real life experience?

As a byproduct of this idea and what’s been shown, I def think we’re dealing with ‘nested simulations’ and/or ‘nested consciousnesses’ as well — if that makes sense.",1,1649578725,501

To everyone else, this is a good show, this last ep was a damn good show, but I really am really really *really* fucking tired of mystery boxes and I just know in my heart the whole secret of Lumen and Kier is going to be so fucking disappointing. More so if its continually stretched out and out and out. (Yes, they want to implant everyone with Severance chips, but why? Why the whole point of Severance? Is it really that important to let mind wiped prisoners get paid and keep up appearances if you have the power to make the world think their dead anyway and just use them as disposable drones (Hi Dichen Lachman, I remember you doing this in Dollhouse 12 years ago).   


That being said, the acting in this show is top notch from all involved. The cinematography is gorgeous. Set design is good, music is decent. Cool meta Adam Scott intro sequence.

They said something to that effect when the use it on Dylan. I believe the line was “when you initiate the OTP a piece of both selves remains behind”. Which is why iDylan knows he has a son and is so hell bent on doing this. 

Cobel was fired by the board, the board is Helly, she would want to see the place burn and Helena/Helly go down. But she’s got a bigger reason for wanting reintegration to be possible. I think she has a daughter that was in a coma (thanks to the folks that came up with that Gemma theory and how she’s dead but exists as an innie) and is on the testing floor as an innie. If she can prove that reintegration is possible then her daughter (see the shrine she has set up) can come back into the “real” world with her. What happened all serves to Cobel’s theory and benefit.

Edited to add: there has to be something to Cobel’s theory too: iHelly hates Cobel’s and suddenly the board of which Helena is part of, fires her even after making quota.

Unlike other female characters such as Alice who accidentally falls down the rabbit hole and Dorothy who is blown away to Oz, the little mermaid chose knowingly to go to the surface.

What happened with the lady who made the reintegration? What do they actually do with that data? So many interesting misteries and nothing advanced, we didn't get any single hints.

Yes, there are still plenty left unanswered, that that's the nature of these types of shows, and it always confuses/irritates me when people complain about it.  If you don't like that aspect of it, it's not your type of show.  Can you imagine how boring lost would have been if they showed all their cards in the first season?

This is why the CEOs daughter is giving a speech and there is legislative interest.

Gemma's comments about only being alive for a few hundred hours and existing only at 30 min intervals, with the 8 hour Helly watch being the best time of her life might mean that the process is still experimental since it seems like not having the Outie component causes extreme stress or awareness that there is no life outside.

As the chief security guy, having Graner having an ""off the grid"" access card makes it so when he has to do quasi-illegal things there is no trail to show where and when he was at places. That might make it harder to revoke a clearance that ""doesn't exist"".

The smaller staff of ""bosses"" seems to overestimate the control and security that Severance and their systems actually have. They  couldn't conceive several factors:

* That Graner ran into and was overpowered by Mark on the outside, and stole his keycard, and brought it to Lumon.

* That Dylan was made aware of the override protocol, and his desire to see his kid would make him act unselfishly when given rewards.

* That they knew where the security room was, that the override protocols could be stolen and studied, and can actually be done by a single person.

* Milcheck seemed to use the override protocol for what seemed like a minor problem. It could be that it was in fact a major problem, like that the ""messages get erased in the elevator"" idea is bullshit, and they manually remove messages that are trying to be smuggled out, or there is a loophole for certain things.

For Irv &amp; Dylan, their outies will go back to work like normal, even if their innies want to destroy Lumon.

i5chw95,9,U_R_A_BoldOne,"Devon almost certainly wouldn't have had any way to know about revolving (whatever that turns out to be). She freaked out because she learned that the woman she'd trusted with her baby had been lying about her identity and was actually Mark's boss at the company she'd presumably just learned very concerning things about. I don't think her concerns were any more specific than ""I left my baby with a potentially dangerous woman and now they're both missing.""",6,1650378561,78
i5cm8o4,9,U_R_A_BoldOne,"&gt;Are their jobs of putting numbers in boxes just fake? Is it just commentary on how stupid corporate jobs can be?

I think MDR's job really is to refine data, only it's not to refine the data Lumon *gives* them; it's to refine the data that Lumon has *about* them. Lumon doesn't actually need the MDR team to refine the data on the workstations because that data has already been refined. They show a percentage completeness for each data bucket and eventually play the little video of Kier when the refining is complete. You can't calculate a percentage unless you already know the denominator, which means that Lumon already knows how much of each type of data there is in each bucket. If Lumon doesn't care about the data each MDR employee works on, then there must be something else they care about.

I think the job is some sort of test that Lumon is doing on the MDR workers themselves, although I'm not sure what the end goal is. Maybe they're trying to find people whose brains behave in a specific way when presented with the task of ""refining"" the data.",3,1650380262,192

i5cn1t3,9,Thegreylady13,"You’re absolutely right, and yet I don’t think you say anything that Mrs. Selvig says. Perhaps 1/20th of her dialogue is something a current earth human might say (I’m not saying the show is poorly written- I love her dialogue and something about her is clearly not simple modern earth human, even if it’s only that she’s putting on a persona). I’m not sure if telling your neighbor his body tensed is that much stranger than the way she discarded her doll baby during the nursing lesson. It’s as if she wants to infiltrate their lives and knows she has to be just ingratiating enough to be allowed to penetrate further, but has zero concerns about whether or not she’s making them incredibly uncomfortable in the process. I also felt bad for Devon, because there are clear signs that Selvig is off, but she seems lonely enough (she lost her close friend Gemma, she likely feels like she lost a lot of Mark and is clearly actively worried about him every day, she’s a new mother which I’ve heard can be both enchanting and lonely/confusing/devastating in ways, her husband also seems to be going through something very strange and broad as a coping mechanism, and she has to put up with his insufferable friends who aren’t really like human friends but aren’t quite rude enough to actually dislike without feeling like she’s the asshole. She has to feel pretty lonely) at the moment to just be happy to have a conversation with someone. Outtie Mark is so shut off to his feelings that I don’t think she’s been able to talk to what seems to be her best friend for a while. And this started sometime soon after when her very close friend/sister-in-law was also taken from her. And her husband is sweet, but wholly self-obsessed (he’s still sweet and I don’t think he notices- he’s dealing with his pain by regressing into childhood. I think back to the scene when he dropped off the book. He’s so excited, and oblivious to Devon’s affectionate irritation- but it doesn’t really seem selfish, just very self-interested or childlike).

They said before that they could wake up while driving or in any scenario, so to be prepared. And the innies seem to be really aware that they have zero idea who they are on the outside, so I guess Mark has to think he could know Cobel. They could be lifelong friends. I think it would freak me out, too and I wouldn’t hold it together that easily, but their whole innie lives are stressful and I think they had really stressed to one another that, no matter what is happening on the outside, they can’t act out of place- they just have to act like an outie (hard, because they don’t know what any outie acts like, much less them), find someone they trust, and spill the bees.",4,1650382278,162

i5cucka,9,Thegreylady13,"I think that speaks to the fact that, in experience, they’re babies. I don’t think that they have the life experience to know what “planning it out better so they could try to get as much info,etc.” even might look like. I was frustrated at the same things, but I think it makes sense. Their important work is looking at numbers and clicking them once, then clicking to make the box close. To them, that’s a vital grown-up job. I’m almost surprised that, with the tasks they’ve performed in innie life, Helly and Dylan were pretty good at understanding the numerous steps in the instructions for the OTC, but they still have their outside brains- they can follow a guide. They still process clues and solve puzzles fairly easily when they receive information. But they’re operating with almost zero information, which is how they keep clever adults so baby like. But everything is so simplistic and easy and they’re so babyfied by their employers, that even though they know that this is a vital, dangerous mission, and that they have perilously limited time, they may not know what an effective plan is. They’re like incredibly smart kids who will still make rookie errors when trying to lie/obfuscate because they simply haven’t done it before and haven’t learned about any of the tells or questions a parent might ask to discern the lie. They can’t possibly know what they don’t know, or that this perilous mission is a whole hell of a lot more complicated than almost anything they’ve ever done- they likely think a difficult task is roughly as difficult as Helly finishing off her file earlier, and that the hardest mountains in life can be climbed as long as someone stands behind while chanting your name.",3,1650383372,297
i5cylkt,9,JaunxPatrol,"I think this gets at the whole structure of the show. You could look at it as a sci-fi/horror premise executed as a comedy, with the humor derived from the contrast between how ridiculous and cringy Ricken is to us and on the outside, and how hugely influential and revered he is to the innies.

Sort of like how Get Out is a comedy premise (what if old white people...had to pretend to be black??) executed as a horror film.",2,1650385021,80

i5dbkpk,9,Thegreylady13,"I sort of feared that, too, but I almost always assure myself (especially when theorized on threads, like the Servant thread) that shows and movies very seldom show a person deliberately murder a baby. It’s just not something you see a lot (and I think it’s cheap as a plot device and unnecessary, but that may be part of the denial I’m about to explain). I don’t want to watch someone kill a baby- I have a visceral reaction to it (like eye related horror. I don’t like watching gore or murder and it makes me uncomfortable but adds to a show, but I won’t watch my favorite damn show if they start taking too many eyes or killing babies.). I think that most people feel this way, which is why we don’t see it often (I’m not saying that anyone would enjoy it as a plot point, I actually think that people would be averse to it in a way that we just aren’t averse to many other unpleasant scenes). I also like to think that in the writers room, if someone suggested that Cobel murder the baby, someone would say, “That’s incredibly gauche. If we can’t make an exciting show without including ladies who murder other people’s babies for absolutely no gain, we probably shouldn’t be writing a show.”",3,1650389917,221
i5ddgg5,9,Thegreylady13,"Exactly. Murdering the baby could not have been done without jumping the shark. There’s no utility to killing a baby, and I don’t want to watch shitty people make nonsensical decisions. I hated Walter White from the moment he watched Kristen Ritter die, but there was some utility to that choice. I’ll watch a shitty person who lacks scruples make decisions that make sense to me (every character does dumb shit 10% of the time so that there’s conflict; I can accept that- but baby murder isn’t your typical dumb plot device and people just don’t murder babies they aren’t related to- they steal them. Well, occasionally a babysitter murders a baby, but Selvig isn’t on the level of the predictably very low functioning folks who do that). Killing a baby make no sense. Maybe, if she had the baby as a hostage and wanted something, it would make sense but be stupid- but I don’t want to watch that ham-fisted show. That’s pure camp. It’s like when people suggest that someone in the show Servant actively murdered a baby- I love sitting and stewing in the atmosphere of that show, and I won’t want to spend another second there if one of those family members killed a baby for no reason (Dorothy can be quite scary, but smug asshole and baby murderer aren’t even remotely close).",1,1650390612,227

Cobel didn’t seem to have any qualms about sending her down there, so I don’t think she’s against it on principle (unless she thinks that Ms. Casey is fundamentally less human than the others- which she has basically said- or she has a special interest in Mark, Dylan and Irving).

Dylan: Perhaps his wife left him and he is a single dad trying to deal with the grief of divorce?
Helly: To gain favor in her family, publicity stunt for Lumon. 

They are all vulnerable and trying to escape pain in their normal life. Perhaps there is also an element where they believe they are able to sort out their lives and memories in Lumon. Perhaps a mental health aspect to the whole thing.

He just seemed exactly like a person in that moment. Maybe they would make him only able to appreciate Lumon writings, but I really think he seemed like a normal Earth human in that scene- not like Cobel who pontificates about Jack Frost’s dandruff. I think he may be a person who works there but is very good at calculating how to handle the severed team members (but something is different now. I think the same kindergarten management tactics have worked for years and that Milchick is less on his toes now than he seems. He’s very good and fast and I think he’s had most of these folks in the palm of his hand for years, so he is less suspicious of them than he should be and simply doesn’t consider that a coffee coozie is not going to work on Dylan anymore, at all).

Oh, and he does seem too happy doing this- except when things go wrong, in which case I think he’s much more irritated and exasperated than troubles about having to take more drastic measures. I think he’s not troubled about this because he, like Helena and Jame and Gabby, simply does not see severed innies as people. He is as troubled about this as I might be if I don’t let my stuffed bear sit next to my stuffed turtle (probably less troubled- I used to think it was imperative to love all of my stuffed animals equally, like facts in a wellness session), because they’re things to him.",2,1650483308,321

As for the  risk of self-harm, I think it goes back to the slave comparison: they have such a low opinion of the innies and have such an iron fist rule over them that they don’t even view an “uprising” or a self-harm attempt as a serious possibility. It’s either that, or they just didn’t truly realize the extent of what severance *does* to someone until that moment—they may have assumed that iHelly would still have some similarity of motivation to oHelena.

The tasks at work seem stupid and meaningless, and I think that they actually may be. Probably those are just meant to test the subjects that received the severance procedure and mean nothing, and those who “successfully” perform those tasks just become citizens brainwashed, maybe replacing their outies somehow (something like the “larva” rumor that Burt mentioned). 

Helena’s father also mentions that everyone should be severed, but I think that doesn’t necessarily mean severed between work/personal life, but also replacing other parts of people’s lives (like motherhood, as Gabby does), and sometimes the entire life of someone. 

Mrs Casey (Gemma) also could be an experiment that is only awake while she is innie, replacing her outie entirely, which may be exactly their long term plan.

Edit: as for the motives to create an entire brainwashed city, I think that the founder may believe that the innies that are “raised” inside Lumos are better people, being born as blank slates and following Kier principles.

i671z3q,9,HRHDechessNapsaLot,"I doubt Severence, as it exists now, was even Kier’s philosophy in 1866. Hell, probably Kier was just a philosopher, wondering about the different “selves” of one person. (Which thematically would have been very appropriate in a post-Civil War America, where the country was quite literally divided in half both physically and in mentality). My guess is that Kier himself was rather normal, and that over the decades, this hero worship took place within the Egan family and they sort of idealized and morphed Kier from a smart, thoughtful but generally non-awful guy into this sort of diety that they now worship.  Eventually technology caught up to this idea of two selves and the Egans found a way to use the Severance process as a way to physically reincarnate themselves as well.

The baby goats being nurtured and the guy saying they’re not ready yet makes me think what the Egans are actually doing is eventually severing themselves and putting the severed copy into a young child. (The “revolving.”)",17,1650928665,169

I could be wrong. It's all speculation at this point. But I'm gonna bet money I'm right.

 &gt;The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a clinical scale used to reliably measure a person's level of consciousness after a brain injury. The GCS assesses a person based on their ability to perform eye movements, speak, and move their body. These three behaviors make up the three elements of the scale: eye, verbal, and motor. A person's GCS score can range from 3 (completely unresponsive) to 15 (responsive).

But the outies got no such warning.  As soon as Irving got behind the wheel of the car, he was risking the possibility that his outie would with no warning find himself going in the blink of an eye from standing in his house with a paintbrush in his hand to being on the road gripping the steering wheel.

Irving.    

What the actual fuck was he doing on the outside?   

Everyone knew they had limited time and their goal was to try to get some information to their outie or to someone trusted.   

Irving decides he's going to look up Burt, who he's got a crush on / connection with... ON THE INSIDE.   

On the outside, Burt has no fucking clue who Irving is, and he decides it's a good idea to waste time driving all the way across town to go find Burt. He then sees that Burt already has a husband and decides to bang on his door like a crazy man, screaming out ""BURT! BURRRRRTT!""    

What exactly does he think is going to happen when Burt opens the door and sees a man he's never seen before telling him all kinds of nonsensical ramblings? He's going to call the cops.   

Helly was able to figure out who she was and decided she could get the truth out by sabotaging her outie's speech. Bravo Helly, you did the most out of everyone.   

Mark takes a while but manages to figure out he can trust his sister and explains everything to her. He messed up by calling Ms. Cobel by her real name but it's hard to blame him for that since he at least handled seeing her on the outside pretty well, which must've been quite shocking, the first thing you see on the outside is your oppressive boss who is hugging you.

iao5m2s,9,Corgi-Ambitious,"Just finished it and some final thoughts:

- That finale was honestly a bit disappointing. I know it won't be popular in a fan sub about the show but to reveal *so* little after 8 episodes of build-up, to leave the viewer with no big new revelation to chew on until the 2nd season, is shitty. The way they effectuated it is also shitty - they divided the episode into following the viewpoint of each of the four different MDR employees but did NO time skips when jumping between them, even for stuff that could've easily been implied. We don't need to see Irving struggle to open a box for two minutes, and we could've jumped to him in the car already after finding the map, instead of watching him go through the arduous process of *finding and starting his car*. That isn't expositive, and it's obvious the writers used all that as cheap filler to only reveal the tiny bits they wanted to while still giving off the impression of providing a full episode. Don't get me wrong - I love shows like this and the show especially is fantastic, but that finale was a ton of filler for very little payoff.

- The guy who plays Seth Milchick, Tramell Tillman, is an incredible actor. You can tell he dove deeply into that character and everything he did was brilliant. Gave off crazy levels of Oscar Isaac in *Ex Machina* vibes, especially with the dancing. Tillman is going to be a star.

- The most passionately charged 'will-they, won't-they"" moment on TV in 2022 so far was between a 79-year-old Christopher Walken and a 65-year-old John Turturro in the greenhouse and no one can tell me otherwise. So well done lol.

Overall, I'm loving the show and really hope season 2 holds as many high-level answers to all the high-level questions posed in season 1. Can't wait (gonna get severed).",1,1654009845,321

iav4tv0,9,empfindsamkeit,"It's a non-answer because no one was asking that question. There wasn't any real question posed by the show as to who she was, just basic curiosity - Mark was the only whose outtie we really knew anything about (among the 4), but there was no reason to assume the rest of them weren't everyday schlubs like him. It's fair to call it a twist or a reveal, but not an answer. Even if there was some ""question"" raised by the show, people on this subreddit called it back in episode 3 or earlier. I don't really think the clues they used supported drawing that conclusion, but whatever.

And the problem is that we learn who Helly is in the 1-2 minutes. Almost everything else was fake tension and wasted screen time. Is Mark going to get a minute alone with his sister? Or is he going to keep getting interrupted by Ricken/the baby/Cobel? Irv just slowly meanders around his apartment and discovers that his outtie is a veteran who's infiltrating Lumon for some reason. Cool. Did we really need to see that set up over 5-10 min?

I personally couldn't believe that we were expected to believe Dylan was making this all possible and holding things together by just reaching his arms extra far and displaying superhuman endurance. *After* running out on the waffle party orgy, which apparently triggered no suspicion and no one bothered to report.",1,1654136110,238
iav6jz6,9,empfindsamkeit,"I was enjoying the show up until the last couple episodes. I just watched the finale and it was a big let-down. It answered almost no questions for me and dragged everything out interminably.

Mark manages to finally tell his sister about Lumon and Cobel, and realizes his wife is still alive and possibly conveys it. None of this is new to us. The only other thing that happens is he lets slip to Cobel that he's an innie. Who just runs off to try and stop them. But we spend like 1/3 of the episode or more on him getting blue-balled trying to tell someone.

Helly finds out in the first minute that she's an Eagan shilling for the severance procedure. She manages to blurt out to everyone at the end that innies are treated terribly. Unknown whether her outie will successfully walk it back. Cobel unsuccessfully threatens her with the torture of her coworkers. We waste at least 1/3 of the episode on this.

Irv finds out he is/was in the military and is trying to infiltrate Lumon for some unknown reason. Otherwise, he spends the episode wandering around or driving to find Burt, whose outie is already in a relationship and won't remember him.

Dylan holds two switches the whole episode and Milchick slowly saws his way in with a knife while trying to persuade him to let him in early.

I just don't think there was enough there to fill a 45min episode. The tension was also completely ineffective IMO; I was just getting annoyed. I expected the OTC was temporary and they would either get caught or Dylan's arms would give out (stupid as that would've been) by the end. The only question was whether they'd actually get to achieve their aims before then or if they'd drag it out even further into the next season, and they all *kind of* managed at the last minute in a completely conventional made-for-TV fashion. The ""obstacles"" were completely contrived. Mark can't manage to get a minute alone with anyone because he's constantly interrupted by petty shit. Helly is just wandering around waiting her turn to deliver her very conveniently-timed speech. Irv is just slow. Dylan's predicament is laughably implausible on every level.",1,1654136969,375

He could've told her it's an emergency and the breast-feeding could wait.

iavekq5,9,empfindsamkeit,"&gt; He worked out who his sister was and waited until they were alone.

He worked that out in his 2nd scene after getting away from Cobel. His sister even tells him she'll be ready to have the ""life-changing"" talk with him after she's done pumping or breastfeeding or whatever. Instead of telling her that it's an emergency and it can't wait, he just wanders around very passively until he can finally get her alone. It's not like Cobel was shown breathing down his neck the entire time and he couldn't tell her without tipping his hand. Cobel was absent for long stretches and he made almost no effort to see his sister.

&gt; Helly spoke out against severance in front of a crowd at Lumon

With seconds to spare. She's extremely lucky her speech wasn't scheduled any later or that Milchick didn't find Dylan or cut through the door earlier. Otherwise all she would've accomplished was learning she was an Eagan which she finds out in the first few seconds.

&gt; Mark found someone he trusted and told her everything

He took an extremely long time as already covered. I didn't get the impression at all that he felt like the clock was ticking.

&gt; It took Irv the longest to find someone he trusted, and he didn't get there in time, but he did his best. 

Not only did he drag his feet and ultimately fail, but outtie Burt isn't really someone he can trust. He's effectively a complete stranger. By his logic, he could've trusted oHelly just because iHelly is trustworthy, when that clearly isn't the case.

It seems like oIrv already knows about Lumon or is at least suspicious and likely to crack the case himself before long. Leaving some kind of clue to himself probably would've been the best use of his time.",1,1654141260,308
iavi4gn,9,empfindsamkeit,"I'm with you. I assumed that's what the box with the paperweight was. Some kind of clever way of getting Lumon to aid their escape plan with a seemingly innocuous object. Instead it's just a sappy paperweight which gives him the mental fortitude to hang on to the switches?

Also:

1) He insists he can reach far enough to hit both switches. He's never seen the room or the switches. No one mentions measuring his arm or the doors or anything (they know the switches are located on either side). Good thing it worked out!

2) He runs off from the waffle party orgy. The dancers notice and no one reports him or seemingly notices. At first, I assumed Milchick and everyone went home, though that seemed like a plot convenience too. But he's shown to actually be there. Doing what, exactly? Are other departments working overnight? The parking lot is shown to be basically empty at the end of the day. Shouldn't he be overseeing things from the security office? Was no one worried what happened to Graner's card?

3) He not only manages to barely reach the switches, but he manages to keep them constantly engaged from a stress position for at least 15-20 minutes despite being pretty out of shape. Possibly an hour or longer.

4) Milchick takes at least 5 minutes to cut through a taut necktie with a big, sharp-looking knife. If the knife's not serrated or the serrated part can't reach, and the tie had been coiled up tight I could maybe buy this. But I'm pretty sure I could've been through that tie with that knife in under a minute.",1,1654143351,277

that might explain why selbig is always watching, and I think she may have some disagreement with the board about whether the tech is 'ready' for mainstream launch... which the big event at lumen in ep9 seems to be all about.

i half expect that maybe lumen will manage to escape expose by hellie R at the start of S02, like maybe o-hellie manages to pull off a 'just kidding' recovery, and probably oMark doesn't believe the 'shes alive' announcement - like maybe figuring he must be talking about someone else.

my guess is that we will see severance being used in mainstream - in the Dan interview he does hint that we will begin to see more applications for severance in further seasons, and maybe the MDR team will be transferred to some other job, like 'orientation' programs for the influx of new 'commercial' innies, ...

I think its a pretty sure bet that military applications will be part of the story development, and so it seems that irv's background forms an important part of that plot.

but i also think that military will not be the only way severance will be used - ""you said 'it is so pretty that everyone should have one', and now you are helping to make that true"". apparently the long term goal is for everyone to have a severance chip, perhaps with capacity to activate at will - maybe with more than one 'innie' instance...?",2,1655094325,291

ic86lcl,9,omgshannonwtf,"Wow! I know that it’s two weeks old but you clearly chose violence that day!

I have to say I didn’t feel the finale was disappointing. I liked the little moments as they build tension. I also think there was a lot that we needed to see about what Irving was doing with the box, how he was getting into it, etc (*which I won’t get into here because it’s not germane to discussion and I already covered in a different post specifically about Irving in the apartment but I won’t link to because I’m not bringing it up to point people to it*). I don’t think we always need to gallop; sometimes the tension of being forced to crawl is good. 

Personally, to have witnessed the conversation between iMark and Devon once the two were finally alone might seem like it could have been more engaging because of the shock and emotion and hearing how iMark explained what was going on in the span of a couple of minutes might have been interesting… but it might also have been sluggish and awkward to portray and took us out of the tension. 

The idea that the one key that Irving would need to get into the chest was actually on him at the time rather than literally anywhere else in the apartment isn’t just filler in my opinion. Nor is the notion that he’d pull out a picture of his dad labeled “Dad” or anything else in the chest. 

I think it was good to be forced to crawl through the episode and I’d disagree that there are no new revelations. We now know why iIrving stands at attention any time Milchick enters a room: his outie would have learned that after repeatedly standing at attention when a commanding officer entered a room back when he was in the military. That suggest that there’s a lot of reflexive behaviors seeping into innie habits. Natalie fucking tackling Helly at the gala suggests a level of zeal that we really didn’t think she may have had. What’s THAT conversation going to be like the moment they pull them apart? Because she probably hit the floor as Helena. 

We knew who Miss Casey really was but iMark didn’t and now Devon and Ricken know she’s alive too and they’re going to be pleading with oMark, who doesn’t want to reintegrate and has no way to find that doctor now after having given back Petey’s phone. Devon is going to have to explain to Ricken who Mark was for the last hour and the conversations they had and try to get info on Gemma which Mark isn’t going to know, he drank his sorrows away and severed to have 8 hours where he could function… and his innie thinks she’s alive? He’s not going to believe that and we’ve yet to see the angry, truly destructive drunk side of him. That might be coming.

Given their distaste for the book and it's author, I'm willing to bet they've been forced to read his work before. What is odd is that they forgot about replacing it, as they seemed to originally be prepared to screen the book and return it to the porch, presumably before Mark was told it was missing.

So many twists and turns with plenty of wtf is going on moments but the whole season was a massive thrill ride. It was absolutely gripping. 

The artistry and cinematography was on point and arghhhhh I want more!!!!! 

The concept and synopsis could 100% of been made in to a Hollywood blockbuster BUT I personally think that we are on the cusp of the traditional 90-120 minute movie dying and being replaced by shows such as this.

iejkamj,9,Lennvor,"I feel a bit bad that most scenes with Devon and Ricken involve Devon being low-key dismissive of him. I think it makes some cinematic sense because Mark is high-key dismissive of him and most of the Devon scenes we have are really Devon scenes with Mark and Ricken is just nearby - so I guess those scenes are supposed to tell us more about Mark and Devon's relationship and Mark and Ricken's than about Devon and Ricken's. And what we're told is that ""Mark thinks what Ricken just said or did is annoying and Devon makes a joke out of it but lowkey agrees"".

&amp;#x200B;

The most reasonable interpretation to me is that Devon is more like Mark in her outlook and therefore agrees that Ricken is a bit silly and that his book isn't his best contribution to this world, but that she loves him because he has other aspects that she thinks the world of and that are much more important to her. And I think it's very reasonable to think Ricken has those aspects! Like you say he seems to be a loving husband and kind person, and to that I think I might add that he seems emotionally open in a way that's interesting. I can imagine many reasons Devon *might* love Ricken.

&amp;#x200B;

What I wish is that they had *scenes showing us* how much Devon loves him and why. Like, one scene of the two of them laughing at a private joke or being totally in tune on some random subject.

The show is very literally an exploration of human(ish) violence - the disconnect between the fact that we consume violent media (yes, like Westworld) but that few of us have any actual penchant for committing it ourselves. Does our consumption of violent media point at some subconscious desire to actualize real violence? What would it look like if we built a scenario that enabled it? What kind of people would take advantage of that kind of opportunity and why? Philosophically, is that kind of violence (against supposed non-human, in some morally relevant way, hosts) morally inert? What are the moral ramifications of that kind of violence if it turns out we're wrong about the nature of the victims or indeed the nature of what makes violence wrong in the first place? More importantly, is violence only morally wrong because of the hard done to its targets or might it also be wrong because of how it slowly corrupts the person who inflicts it? 

Put simply: the violence in Westworld **is the point** and it's almost always in service of the show's greater philosophical themes - the literal polar opposite of it being ""mindless"".",2,1657524959,203

Also, Peg from the letter starts working at Lumon in  MDR after a traumatic incident at her job as a school bus driver. She crashes the bus in the freezing cold and has to deal with the children as well as a hostile boss. Maybe not fully PTSD worthy, but it clearly makes a mark on her.

Knowing I was responsible for whatever was going to happen to those children in the coming seconds. As their screams rang in my head, I did something that contradicted my better judgment.

They went over the plan about finding someone you trust as quick as you can and telling them what is going on. It made no sense for Mark to sit through any of Ricken's reading. As soon as he learned who his sister was, he should have told her he needed to talk immediately and not stopped until she listened to him. 

Helly and Irv I understand a little more, but definitely expected more urgency. Helly is thrown into the midst of a lot of people in a very formal setting and her first focus is acting the part and figuring out what is going on. She also has no one she can actually trust there and learns that pretty quickly so chooses to wait until her speech to say anything. Irv has the opposite happen where he wakes up around no one and does not have much to go from. I thought he should have been searching through his house more quickly or maybe writing himself a note (not sure why all of them didn't do this in some way), but nothing much would have come of it because it seems like he has no one on the outside to go to.",1,1665785051,224

Also happening in episode 8 but I still hate the forced romance between Marc and Helly. Random ass kiss between what appeared to be two friends with zero sexual chemistry the entire season and all of a sudden they’re in love with each other? Lame path I was hoping they wouldn’t go down
