Anyway everything from the dinner party in Ep 1 onwards has been incredible. Tension building scene by scene and the concept is full of potential. Cant wait for next weeks ep",

I believe this due to her facial expressions but also the fact that she gives Mark conflicting stories about her mothers religiosity depending on which version she is talking to\n\n\\- I'm starting to think the \"employees\" are pre-selected on the outside and brought to Lumon for some significant reason we are yet to see. This could mean that some \"employees\" are more important than others and even that some are only needed for a short while such as Carol D whilst others they intend to keep forever. This is just a theory ofc\n\n\\- I got the impression that Irvs episode was caused by him nearly falling asleep. They seem to be very strict about nobody sleeping on the job. Could just be because they want them to be as productive as possible when sorting the numbers or it could be to do with the chip not working if you sleep at work\n\n\\-I'm very interested in their pay also. There is reference to Irv getting wages docked because of him nodding off but how would they explain that to his Outie? Also in cases such as Marks promotion this would surely involve a wage increase in the normal world but they have no reason to give him one as he doesn't even know about his own promotion. Whole thing seems a bum deal for the worker tbh - I doubt they have a great union either lol. They must have to be real desperate to sign up for the job but I suspect this will be touched on soon\n\n\\- As for the blue thing I haven't thought too much about it. They all seem to have outfits but thats not too unusual for an office job anyway. Would be interesting to see if they go anywhere with it",

If they can recall US states, and basic grammar rules, etc., where does it end?  If their outside self watched a movie in the outside a million times (allowing for some solid encoding to happen), can their inside self recall the events of the movie (not the experience of watching it, just the plot of the movie), or is that too personal?  A piece of media\u2019s plot is not inherently personal, but having seen vs. not seen it can contribute to personality and can tell someone about themselves.\n\nIt seems (based on the film and music facts given to Irving in the wellness room) that they can\u2019t remember things like media or current events.\n\nBut then how is that controlled for or differentiated without interfering with the rest of their (non-personal) semantic memories?",

I was always miserable at my jobs because it was never just about the work. And I wished that it was. But I dwell on every miscommunication, mistake, misinterpretation, and anything my mind is willing  to read into. And the same went for personal problems impacting my work. Being able ignore those things while in the other sounded very pleasing on the surface.\n\nThis is nothing like that but close enough hat I really empathize with people who choose to work there. Which I think could be a hurdle for some people. But I totally get it.\n\nMy explanation was way more sci fi simple. The implant is an on/off switch.

The call itself is unnecessary and the timing is such that it\u2019s the only time the company doesn\u2019t literally have a leash on Mark (and happens to be meeting Petey-more correctly-Petey is introducing himself);\n\n1c) phone call: all back to the phone call lol\u2026if Mrs. Selvig/Mrs. Cobel were truly calling to resolve a situation (or action she and/or he took which caused confusion) there is literally no reason to ask WHERE he was eating. Am I right?;\n\n2) the fact Mrs. Selvig is obsessed over such a trivial problem (or whatever situation) just seems like a ploy to continue to contact him in some way;\n\n3a) appearance: although they are acquaintances (at best) she far too aware of how he smells and comments that he \u201csmells good.\u201d And she\u2019s oddly curious\u2026asking personal questions specifically regarding what he\u2019d been doing that evening and if he\u2019d been on a date (this is the biggest red flag to me) - what neighbor asks if they\u2019d been out on a date while delivering cookies?\n\n3b) appearance: Mrs. Cobel said he looked hungover during the first episode\u2026which means she\u2019s acutely aware of his daily appearance (sorta supports the \u201csmell good\u201d comment). \n\nMy theory is the company is suspecting Petey will contact Mark, and perhaps even entertain the idea he could end up aiding and abetting him (since they were well-known work friends) hence the impromptu visit with cookies.\n\nIs this a common theory? Or am I way off base? lol! I literally JUST saw it for the first time\u2026of course it\u2019s cued now!

I also think the stairwell could represent a sort of purgatory, in some ways it seems to be a no man\u2019s land between work and the outside world. \n\nI also thought it was interesting that work Peggy referenced a quote from her mother about hell and outside Peggy referenced a quote relating to saints. Seems to suggest the basement is hell and outside is a sort of heaven. \n\nThe idea of thirds also seems to be a big theme so far. Another user noted that 1 of the 3 light bulbs being out in Mark\u2019s apartment signifies his 8 hours of consciousness at work (a third of 24 hours)\n\nYou\u2019ll also notice the 3 paintings behind Peggy in episode 1\u2026the first 2 panels are calm but the third panel is a full on storm. Again seems to signify the hellish nature for the \u201cperson\u201d trapped at work. \n\nCan\u2019t wait to see more of this series!",

        "body": "With Mrs. Selvig and the garbage/recycling bins, I'm wondering if there's more to it than her simply wanting to keep checking on him. Of course that's true, but it's also a weird and specific thing to draw attention to. Is it some weird test of his memory as an \"outie\" (remembering that garbage is one day and recycling the next)? Or foreshadowing about what's going wrong in the world: that it's related to garbage/pollution? That could also tie into the black goo, focus on water, the greenhouse, etc. \n\nIrving's weirdness definitely goes beyond simply being older and falling asleep. There's obviously the black goo, but also the way he immediately tried to do a trust fall at the welcome party. I'm thinking severance really has a negative impact long term, and is affecting Irving because he's been working there the longest. \n\nI've also been thinking about the idea of \"re-severance\", that if something isn't working out with an \"innie\" or they need to transfer departments or something, they might \"kill\" the current innie and start everything all over again. That's not what happened with Mark, because we have info about when he started to work at the company, but could be the case for someone like Irving. \n\nLastly, what the hell was up with Irving's outie allegedly liking the sound of radar? This could be another clue about their work. But in general, some of the terms being used are very strange, either outdated or just uncommon.",

So, in your example, if the Outie watched a new movie over and over again, the Innie would have no clue that the movie even existed. Those memories would not register in any capacity in the Innie's consciousness.\n\nI think there is some suspension of disbelief required. The implant is already sci-fi, so it's not a big stretch to assume that it's smart enough to differentiate between personally-identifiable memories and general memories.\n\nBased on the sea theory, the Innies don't even know the state of society. That means they don't have certain specific memories at all, such as what movies were released just before their Severance. I assume that, at the point of Severance, the implant compares the individual's memories to some pre-determined encyclopedia of general knowledge. A list of the states, what an ocean is, the English language, etc. are all retained because those memories match a database, and the implant only pulls those memories when forming the new Innie consciousness.",

As for the mother thing someone said above, it doesn't prove anything, as she could easily have made up a fact about her 'mother' to help feel more rounded in her workplace. I got the distinct impression that despite Seth being apparently subordinate to Mrs Selvig, he's definitely unsevered and possesses much more power than her.  \n\n\nThis seems too well plotted for them to reveal the evil boss lady and the supervisor are both in on it on the outside too...",

We don\u2019t see Petey or any of the other co-workers living in that area)? Why do you think they kept the neighbor\u2019s face cloaked in shadows and didn\u2019t reveal it was her until the end of the episode (i.e, what is the big reveal if it\u2019s just random that she lives next door)? Why is the filming lingering on her face at the end of the episode? Why does Mrs. selvig lie and say she has a shop downtown when she knows (even if severed) that she is Mark\u2019s boss? According to your take, How could she possibly be a successful boss of Lumon if she indeed has dementia? You can\u2019t use severance to split dementia to the outie but not the innie - we don\u2019t see that in-universe.\n\nAt some point, the creators of a show try to impart some certainties so the audience can follow along and comprehend the narrative. Ben Stiller clearly means to impart to the audience that Mark is being spied on by his boss, as a neighbor. For what reason, who knows? \n\nBut turning oneself into a pretzel and ignoring a mountain of evidence is just incorrect. We are clearly meant to understand that Lumon\u2019s reach extends to the outie\u2019s life as well as the innie\u2019s.",

For example, observers often fail to notice major differences introduced into an image while it flickers off and on again. People's poor ability to detect changes has been argued to reflect fundamental limitations of human attention. Change blindness has become a highly researched topic and some have argued that it may have important practical implications in areas such as eyewitness testimony and distractions while driving.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

        "body": "I think you misunderstood me. Any personally-identifiable memories do not transfer over to the Innie, which would mean anything about your family, your preferences, non-general knowledge like how to make specific carpentry joints, etc.\n\nMy current theory is that the company has designed a complete tabula rasa consciousness that isn't formed from *any* of the host's original memories. This consciousness is implanted into the worker's brain to form the start of their Innie identity.\n\nImagine that a serial murderer is captured by the police. He says that he will continue killing the second he gets a chance. He has no hopes of rehabilitation. If you could just wipe his identity and have him start over as a functioning adult, wouldn't that be in the best interest of everyone? You'd turn him from a hopeless criminal to a functioning member of society who can learn to be happy and make others happy.\n\nIn fact, the whole experiment could be to form the best blank slate for resetting the identity of an adult. The numbers, the break room, the rehab... it could all be designed to study the tabula rasa consciousness in order to refine it. Even the way that they have you wake up is utterly bizarre - why would they spread you out on a table? Why would they wait so long to show you the video of your Outie consenting? It's all clearly designed as a test.\n\nThere's also a bit of foreshadowing about this when it was pointed out that Helly's Innie would essentially die if she quit for good; conversely, an Outie can also die if it is permanently replaced by an Innie.\n\nThe theme of death was also revisited by Milchick, when he stated that no one dies there in the office. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but the implication is that death is something that happens to Outies, not Innies.\n\nFinally, Mark hints at this theme a little when he mentions that maybe the point of Severance is to not have to live your normal life for eight hours a day. Mark is depressed and possibly suicidal over the death of his wife. His Innie is much happier. Who's to say that Mark's Innie doesn't merit life just as much if not more than his Outie?\n\n(Sorry for the long rant. I could talk about this show for hours. It's incredible how complex the themes are for only two episodes!)",

I think the stairwell is one such boundary, and what we were seeing was only from the perspective of the 'innie'. In other words the innie walks through the stairwell and becomes the outie. The outie then makes the decision to walk back in, and then the innie resumes consciousness, and to them they never perceived the stairwell at all.

You can tell that Mark is pretty tortured by the death of his wife, and he literally avoids changing his light bulb because he dreads having to sort through his wife's belongings.\n\nAlso Mark's innie was saying he gets motivation from thinking about the effects of sleep, even though he didn't experience it.

Outtie Helly seems eager and a little excited for the process, but also warns she might \u201cfreak out\u201d on Milchik after she\u2019s wiped. (Most people would.) But it gives us a tiny glimpse of her self awareness, and although she seems happy she\u2019s getting severed, she knows she\u2019s got a rebellious streak. It seems that she has shown how their inner personality remains intact, but perhaps the brainwashing/hypnotic break room changes their personalities. Mark\u2019s innie seems very different than is outtie, almost robotic.",
